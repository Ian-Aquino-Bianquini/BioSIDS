AB  - The objectives were to analyze the water and nitrogen use efficiency by forage palm in different irrigation depths with saline water and nitrogen fertilization levels in the Brazilian semi-arid region. The experiment was conducted under field condition during one year of cultivation (360 days). The experimental design was a complete randomized block and 5 x 5 factorial scheme with five irrigation depths (125, 100, 75, and 25% of ET0) and five levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 150, 300, 450 and 600 kg ha-1 of N) and three replicates. Irrigation and acceptable nitrogen fertilization resulted in a good water and fertilization management. Water and nitrogen use efficiency of forage palm were higher, when water depths and the nitrogen levels supplied to the soil were increased. The 125% ET0 depth showed a higher efficiency of water and nitrogen use in the forage palm during 360 days of study. In conditions of low nitrogen supply, the efficiency of nitrogen use is directly and indirectly associated with the fresh mass yield; while under high supply, the efficiency of the use of nitrogen is more effective. The use of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization in the semi-arid region is recommended to obtain higher productivity of water and nitrogen from the forage palm. © 2020 Southern Cross Publishing.

AB  - The sugarcane is the most explored raw material in Brazil to produce ethanol and for each liter of ethanol around 12 L vinasse are produced, thus, the country has high production of vinasse. The vinasse has a very high polluting potential, being considered a solid residue. In general, the vinasse is applied in sugarcane plantations, in some cases with wastewater from plants, promoting the fertirrigation. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of methane generation from the vinasse generated in Brazilian ethanol plants, as well as its potential for thermal and electrical energy generation and economic viability. In all, 377 ethanol plants are registered in Brazil, where 334 are of the annexed type and only 43 autonomous. The results indicate that Brazil has the potential to generate at least 3.53E + 07 m.d-1 of methane, 1.88E + 06 m.d-1 in autonomous plants and 3.34E + 07 m.d-1 in annexed plants. While all the autonomous plants have a minimum production potential of 1.21E + 07 kWh.d-1 of electrical energy and 2.28E + 07 kWh.d-1 of thermal energy, that of annexed plants reach a potential of 2.15E + 08 kWh.d-1 of electrical energy and 4.07E + 08 kWh.d-1 of thermal energy. The costs of producing electricity from methane were about 0.09 R$.kWh-1 for autonomous plants and about 0.06 R$.kWh-1 for annexed plants. NPV has a positive value in all cases indicates that this study, Autonomous plants presented IRR of 51% with a payback of one year and 11,51 months, while the annexed obtained 161% of IRR and payback of 7,56 months. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ethanol distillation produces large quantities of vinasse, a wastewater with high concentrations of organic and inorganic substances that may cause environmental damages if incorrectly disposed. In this way, different alternatives are proposed to enhance the efficiency of vinasse disposal, such as the anaerobic digestion and concentration processes. However, the evaluation of the thermodynamic performance of those systems and their possible energy integration was seldom investigated. Thus, an exergy assessment and comparison of five different scenarios of vinasse disposal, including the vinasse fertirrigation, concentration and anaerobic digestion processes, is presented in this paper. The results indicate that, among the disposal alternatives, the highest exergy efficiency (20.1%) is attained by a system combining anaerobic digestion and vinasse concentration in series. In this case, the wastewater treatment plant produces the maximum amount of biogas, while the vinasse concentration still recovers water and reduce diesel consumption. Furthermore, the heat integration between the biogas power plant and vinasse concentration is able to increase the exergy efficiency of these processes (10–51%) and reduce 9–11% of steam consumption. In general, the major sources of exergy destruction in vinasse disposal alternatives are related with the exergy loss of organic substances in fertirrigation and irreversibilities in steam generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sugarcane is known to be one of the oldest cultivated plants in tropical and subtropical countries. Sugar industries are increasing exponentially to satisfy the growing demand for sugar; whereas, the ethanol distilleries have been rapidly expanding, since bioethanol emerged as an affordable, low carbon footprint and renewable bioenergy. However, inadequately treated and indiscriminate disposal of the effluent from sugarcane industries resulted in extensive soil and water pollutions. Hence, this study aimed at reviewing the sugarcane industrial process with its water consumption rates, and effluent characteristics and its adverse effects on the environment. Finally, the study has gone through the most common wastewater treatment efforts made to minimize the effluent environmental burden. In addition to the large volumes of sugar and ethanol industrial effluents, the presence of the different varieties of the pollutants in the effluent is challenging for conventional treatment methods. However, eliminating the pollutants is becoming important for environmental and esthetic values. In line with this, a number of studies encompassing physicochemical and biological treatment methods have been conducted but many of them failed to be effective. Furthermore, alternative treatments have also been developed such as recycling of vinasse, fertirrigation and concentrated by evaporation but they were not effective either due to the high energy use or the large effluent volumes which cannot be managed through such methods. However, anaerobic digestion of high rate was found in the state of the art and an effective approach to treat the sugar industry and ethanol distillery effluents.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The increase in plant density, combined with the use of hybrids in onion cultivation, has provided significant gains in yield, with a direct impact on the amount of absorbed macronutrients. The present work aimed to evaluate the yield and quality of two onion cultivars under a densified system as a function of potassium doses supplied via fertirrigation. A randomized complete block design was used in a 2 x 7 factorial scheme with four replications. The treatments consisted of two cultivars (IPA 11 and Rio das Antas) and seven potassium doses (0, 70, 140, 210, 280, 350 and 420 kg ha-1 K2O), provided by fertigation. The potassium doses that provided maximum total and commercial yields were 215 and 216 kg ha-1 of K2O, respectively. The soluble solids and the percentage of bulbs of classes 2, 3 and 4 were not influenced by potassium fertilization. There was a reduction in the percentage of non-commercial bulbs with the increase of potassium doses. The dose with maximum economical efficiency was 210.6 kg ha-1 of K2O, responsible for a commercial yield of 61.8 t ha-1. © 2019, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arid. All rights reserved.

AB  - In regions with intense irrigation, the use of fertirrigation increases crop productivity, but excessive fertilizer application increases the risk of soil salinization. Therefore, this work used leaching equations to evaluate systems of remediation of soils salinized by excess fertilizers. The phases of the study were: salinization of soils in lysimeters, remediation of these soils, and measurement of salt concentrations in soils for comparison with estimates of empirical equations. The treatments combined soil remediation systems (continuous and intermittent) with five initial levels of soil salinity (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0 dS m-1). The experimental design was randomized blocks with six replicates. The Volobuyev equation best represented the salinized soil remediation in relation to the results obtained experimentally. The equations tested showed better performance in the intermittent remediation system compared to the continuous system. © The author; licensee Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Background and aims: A large volume of vinasse is generated annually in Argentinean ethanol producing provinces. It has been proposed that vinasses could be used for sugarcane or soybean fertigation. However, basic research to know the effect of vinasse on soil, morphology and crop physiology is scarce in the Argentine northwest. M &amp; M: We provide data on the effect of diluted vinasse (1:1, 1:5 and 1:10 v/v) on photosynthetic CO2 assimilation in soybean plants grown under semicontrolled conditions (greenhouse). Results: Maximum photosynthetic assimilation rate (Amax) was strongly affected by all vinasse dilutions. In the lowest dilution (1:1) the Amax decreased 35% while in highest dilution (1:10) a 15.9% decrease was observed. Changes in Amax were correlated with decreases in stomatal conductance, leaf nitrogen content (Nf) and total chlorophyll. Data of chlorophyll fluorescence show a decrease in Fv/Fm at 1:1 dilution, which indicate a photosystem II (PSII) stress. Conclusions: We can conclude that the application of diluted vinasse affects gas exchange parameters and if it is used it should be done with dilutions 1:10 or higher. Long-term studies are essential to know the effect of vinasse on physicochemical and biological characteristics of soils as well as the probable accumulation of heavy metals in fertirrigated plants. © 2019, Sociedad Argentina de Botanica.

AB  - New technologies have the potential to transform agriculture and to reduce environmental impact through a green revolution. Internet of Things (IoT)-based application development platforms have the potential to run farm management tools capable of monitoring real-time events when integrated into interactive innovation models for fertirrigation. Their capabilities must extend to flexible reconfiguration of programmed actions. IoT platforms require complex smart decision-making systems based on data-analysis and data mining of big data sets. In this paper, the advantages are demonstrated of a powerful tool that applies real-time decisions from data such as variable rate irrigation, and selected parameters from field and weather conditions. The field parameters, the index vegetation (estimated using aerial images), and the irrigation events, such as flow level, pressure level, and wind speed, are periodically sampled. Data is processed in a decision-making system based on learning prediction rules in conjunction with the Drools rule engine. The multimedia platform can be remotely controlled, and offers a smart farming open data network with shared restriction levels for information exchange oriented to farmers, the fertilizer provider, and agricultural technicians that should provide the farmer with added value in the form of better decision making or more efficient exploitation operations and management. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The sugar and alcohol industries provide promising alternative energy sources to replace the use of petroleum derivatives. Vinasse is a byproduct of the alcoholic fermentation of various raw materials, and is used in the fertirrigation of sugarcane plantations. However, its excessive use leads to many soil and groundwater related problems, including toxicity to living organisms, acidification of soil and water, accumulation of heavy metals, and contamination of groundwater. The use of integrated systems, such as stabilization, filtration, and phytoremediation, have attracted interest in the treatment of wastewater from various sources, as these highly effective biogeochemical systems can reduce the pollutant concentrations in wastewater, thereby reducing its adverse effects. The aim of this work was to develop a hybrid treatment system to optimize the physical and chemical characteristics of vinasse so that it can be used as fertilizer for crops with a lower pollution impact. The results of this study validated the effectiveness of the proposed system and demonstrated positive modifications of vinasse. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate potassium doses in the production of sweet pepper, 'Gaston' cultivar, and effects on soil solution extract, using extractors. The research was installed in the greenhouse of the Department of Soils and Environmental Resources of São Paulo State University "Júlio de Mesquita Filho"-Botucatu Campus, and the plants were carried in pots. The experimental design was a randomized block design, with four replicates, using four doses of K2O (363 kg ha-1, 726 kg ha-1, 1088 kg ha-1 and 1451 kg ha-1) applied via drip fertirrigation. Electrical conductivity and specific ion concentration of soil solution extracted weekly, plant height and yield were evaluated. The extractors allowed efficient monitoring and there was significant differences across treatments. Increase in salt concentration in the soil solution reduced plant height, number of fruits and yield. The dose, in addition liming, that provided the highest fruit yield was: 363 kg ha-1 of K2O with 39.2 t ha-1, with an average electrical conductivity over the cycle of 1.7 dS m-1 and concentration of 111 mg L-1 in soil solution extract. © 2019, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

AB  - There are very few studies on the application of fertilizers through irrigation water (fertirrigation) using a multi-gate irrigation system in sugarcane AES. Through fertirrigation, the application of fertilizers can be simplified, and their distribution uniformity in sugarcane fields improved. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art regarding fertirrigation with multi-gate irrigation in sugarcane agroecosystems (AES). In order to systematize, organize, and discuss the scientific data on fertirrigation with low-pressure multi-gate irrigation systems in sugarcane AES, bibliographic material from the following full-text scientific journal databases was screened: the Elsevier Science Direct Freedom Collection, Springer Link, and the International Society for Horticultural Science. Next, a matrix of keywords was used to analyze the interrelationships among the available literature, current issues, and the recent findings. We conclude that development of fertirrigation technologies with low-pressure multi-gate irrigation is much needed. © 2019 Soil Science Society of China

AB  - Studies on irrigation have been undertaken to rationalize the use of water in agriculture. Clogging of drip emitters is one of the most common problems in irrigation. Phosphoric acid was employed as a cleaning agent of drips with red potassium chloride used for fertirrigation. Current assay employed a chemical irrigation system for gravity drips with entrance pressure at low variation, in four experimental treatments: irrigation prior to the use of the chemical irrigation system (T1); fertirrigation with red potassium chloride (T2); chemical irrigation system with phosphoric acid (T3); irrigation posterior to chemical irrigation system (4), with six replications, and 1 h as mean time per replication. Treatments with fertirrigation solutions in a concentration of KCl with 60% potassium were de-obstructed with phosphoric acid at a concentration of 7.086 g L-1. Procedure was analyzed by uniformity coefficients, statistical control graphs and contour maps. Residues from de-obstruction caused a mean 15.13% clogging within drip rows. Results showed that phosphoric acid may be employed as a cleaning agent in drip tubes, although adequate management of the system should be undertaken. © 2019 University Center of Maringa.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of in-ground irrigation and fertirrigation on the development of hybrid eucalyptus Grancam, in the fourth year after its implementation. The experimental design was a randomized block with split plots. The plots were two trickle irrigation systems (drip and micro sprinkler) and no irrigation treatment and the subplots, the conventional fertilization and fertirrigation. It was evaluated: plant height, diameter at breast height and wood volume. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and Tukey test at 5% of significance. The plant height was 13% higher in the drip irrigation and 11% in system micro-sprinkler system, in relation the area without irrigation. The Irrigation showed higher values of diameter at breast height, resulting in a 19.8% increase in the volume production of wood when irrigated by micro and 17.7% when irrigated by drip over the area without irrigation. The irrigation increases volumetric timber production. The drip irrigation increases the efficiency of water use in volume production of wood. The fertirrigation can replace conventional fertilization in irrigated forests. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pomegranate cultivation is gaining importance in many semi-arid areas of the world. This is the case of eastern Spain, where the rainfall regime is well below the crop water needs, and drip irrigation is typically used to control the water and nutrient supplies. This review is a summary of the current information in the literature on pomegranate water and nutrient requirements. Crop responses to variable irrigation regimes and mild to severe water stress are also analyzed. It is concluded that pomegranate water needs can be relatively high during summer, when the crop coefficient can reach values close around 0.6 to 0.9 depending on the tree crop level. In order to cope with water scarcity, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) has been shown as a useful technique for reducing fruit drop in pomegranate trees. RDI strategies during fruit ripening can accelerate fruit color development. Finally some new research has been recently finalized in order to quantify the optimum nutrition plans under conditions of variable water supply. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Universidade Federal de Saõ Carlos, Sorocaba, Brazil ABSTRACT The use of residue of sugarcane ethanol industry named vinasse in fertirrigation is an established and widespread practice in Brazil. Both non-concentrated vinasse (NCV) and concentrated vinasse (CV) are used in fertirrigation, particularly to replace the potassium fertilizer. Although studies on the chemical and organic composition of vinasse and their impact on nitrous oxide emissions when applied in soil have been carried out, no studies have evaluated the microbial community composition and diversity in different forms of vinasse. We assessed the bacterial community composition of NCV and CV by non-culturable and culturable approaches. The non-culturable bacterial community was assessed by next generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and culturable community by isolation of bacterial strains and molecular and biochemical characterization. Additionally, we assessed in the bacterial strains the presence of genes of nitrogen cycle nitrification and denitrification pathways. The microbial community based on 16S rRNA sequences of NCV was overrepresented by Bacilli and Negativicutes while CV was mainly represented by Bacilli class. The isolated strains from the two types of vinasse belong to class Bacilli, similar to Lysinibacillus, encode for nirK gene related to denitrification pathway. This study highlights the bacterial microbial composition particularly in CV what residue is currently recycled and recommended as a sustainable practice in sugarcane cultivation in the tropics. © Copyright 2019 Cipriano et al.

AB  - Three different genotypes of hermaphrodite papaya (Carica papaya L.) derived from in-vitro micropropagation were grown under semi-commercial conditions in a greenhouse located in Yucatán, Mexico. The greenhouse was ventilated, covered with a transparent plastic roof, and fitted with a fertirrigation system. The temperature inside the greenhouse was nearly 40°C over the summer months. Plants were grown under these conditions for 1 year. Plants from all genotypes grew vigorously, and no symptoms of plant pathogens were found. Certainly, there were no incidences of viral or fungal diseases. Under these protected conditions, no sex reversal, flower abortion, nor fruit carpeloidy, or fruit abortion was observed in any of the three genotypes studied. Plants from all three genotypes had high fruit yields and excellent fruit quality. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since bovine dejects contain significant quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus, their inadequate management causes eutrophication of water bodies and soil pollution. However, their correct management is beneficent to soil and crops, and reduces the use of conventional chemical fertilizers. Current study evaluates the application of biofertilizers from a dairy Livestock Water Residue (LWR) within the physical and chemical characteristics of planosols. Assay was undertaken on the EMBRAPA Gado de Leite experimental farm in Coronel Pacheco MG Brazil. Four doses (0, 10, 20, 30 kg ha-1 N) of bio-fertilizer and NPK 30-00-20 were applied in corn crops. Texture, pH, density, electric conductivity, organic matter (OM), effective (CTCt) and potential cationic exchange capacity (CTCT), sum of bases (SB), saturation by aluminum (m) and by bases (V), exchangeable rates of Ca, K, Mg, N and disposable rate of P at 0 - 20 cm layers of soil were evaluated. Bio-fertilizer doses of LWR provide similar effects to conventional fertilization in the soil with regard to macronutrient, micronutrients and fertility indexes. Results show that the partial replacement of conventional nitrogen fertilization by LWR bio-fertilizer is possible. © 2019 University Center of Maringa. All rights reserved.

AB  - The impressive improvement of the applications of compostable bio-polymers in “conservative agriculture” and “precision farming” is introducing a new generation of integrated agro-technologies, driving to the diffusion of the “resilient agro-culture of the third millennium”. This evolution is piloting the traditional “sustainable agriculture” to the holistic and wider “concept” of agro-culture, where the contribution of advanced technologies is defining new standards of the third millennium. This new “concept” means the migration to an innovative model of resilient and holistic agriculture, applied to soil and plants and characterized by the integration of precision farming technologies, compostable mulching, water conservation, fertility improvement, pesticides minimization, GMO-free biotechnologies, improvement of the biodiversity of crop systems with strengthening, of the “homeostasis” of the agro-eco-system. The positive results of the last five years of experiences come either from intensive or from extensive crops in three continents. Compostable fully-degradable mulching is rapidly becoming a pivoting technical factor for environmental care, as well as for quantity, quality and safety of staple food crops like rice, maize, pulses, cassava and oil crops. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - In Almeria, pepper (Capsicum anuum L.) crops represent a very important production sector, with approximately 7000 ha being grown year around. Many agronomical techniques have been adopted with the aim of increasing the commercial yield, such as fertirrigation, biosolarization, trellising and integrated pest management. Nevertheless, the use of grafted plants is still not well implemented in this region, mainly due to the absence of satisfactory commercial rootstocks. In this experiment, three commercial pepper rootstocks were assessed. An experiment was designed with four different treatments and three replicates of each were distributed in fully randomized blocks; three of the treatments corresponded to grafted plants using pepper ‘Bily’ cultivar as scion onto different rootstocks ‘Atlante’ (currently Oscos), ‘AR40’and ‘Tresor’ using non-grafted ‘Bily’ cultivar as the control test. Parameters of yield were measured. The average yield plant-1 showed significant difference between the control test and the grafted plants. The results indicate that the use of certain rootstocks increases the yield expressed in kg plant-1 © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The uncertainty surrounding the part played by an invasive North American seed bug, Leptoglossus occidentalis, in the observed decrease in seed production of the Mediterranean pine, Pinus pinea, is a limiting factor for its management. Furthermore, the possibility of increasing cone production through irrigation and fertilization regimes is gaining interest among landowners, but its effects on insect pests are still unknown. Using bagged branches in the field, we aimed at evaluating the impact of L. occidentalis on young and mature cones of stone pine trees submitted to fertirrigation (FR) compared to trees with no treatment (C). For two consecutive years (2015 and 2016), we carried out both an insect-exclusion trial and an insect-bagged trial. In the first one, polyester-covered branches, excluding insects, were compared to branches exposed to natural insect infestation. In the second trial, bags included either two adult bugs or 3–4 third-instar nymphs, placed there for one month during mid-summer, or were kept without insects. Branch protection resulted in a significant decrease in the mortality of second-year conelets which dropped to 6% compared to 30% in exposed branches. Seed damage also decreased from 60% on exposed branches to 10% on protected ones. The presence of nymphs in the bags resulted in a mortality of second-year conelets 63% higher than in exclusion bags, whereas adults had no effect. In contrast, bags with adults presented the highest seed damage. The partial damage of the kernel can be a signature of L. occidentalis feeding since such damage was not observed in exclusion bags. Additionally, another type of seed damage, showing a wholly shrunken and dry embryo without remaining endosperm, and a reduction in the number of extractable seeds may also be attributed to this seed bug. Overall, seed damage per mature cone reached up to 12% in bags with two adult bugs enclosed for a month, i.e., twice the seed damage in protected cones. Overall, FR trees were more susceptible to both conelet mortality and seed damage. In the particular case of L. occidentalis, FR regime influenced the consumption positively by the nymphs but not by adults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The world is facing a water quality crisis resulting from continuous population growth, urbanization, land use change, industrialization, unsustainable water use practices and wastewater management strategies, among others. In this context, wastewater treatment (WWT) facilities are of vital significance for urban systems. Wastewater management clearly plays a central role in achieving future water security in a world where water stress is expected to increase. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be used as a tool to evaluate the environmental impacts associated to WWTPs and improvement options. In this study, LCA is applied to compare the environmental performance of different scenarios for wastewater and sludge disposal in a WWT plant located in Southern Italy. The first scenario (BAU, Business As Usual) is based on the present sludge management performed within and outside the case-study plant: after mechanical treatment, dewatered sludge is transported by truck to a landfill for final disposal, while treated water is released to a river. The second scenario (B) assumes a partially circular pattern, with anaerobic fermentation of sludge to biogas, biogas use for electricity and heat cogeneration, integrated by additional thermal energy from previously recovered waste cooking oil (WCO), electricity and heat feedback to upstream WWT steps (including sludge drying), and final disposal of dried sludge to landfill and water to river. The third scenario (C) suggests an improved circular pattern with gasification of the dried sludge to further support heat and electricity production (with very small delivery of residues to landfill). The fourth scenario (D) builds on the third scenario in that the volume of treated wastewater is not discharged into local rivers but is partially used for fertirrigation of Salix Alba fields, whose biomass is further used for electricity generation. In doing so, the water P and N content decreases and so does the water eutrophication potential. Finally, a renewable scenario (E) is built assuming that the electricity demand of the WWT plant is met by a green electricity mix, for comparison with previous options. The most impacted categories in all scenarios result to be Freshwater Eutrophication Potential (FEP) and Human Toxicity Potential (HTP). Increased circularity through recycling in scenarios B and C reduces the process contribution to some environmental impact categories such as Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Fossil Depletion Potential (FDP), but does not provide significant improvement to FEP. Fertirrigation in scenario D lowers FEP by about 60% compared to the BAU scenario. Furthermore, HTP is lowered by almost 53%. Finally, other options are discussed that could be also explored in future studies to evaluate if and to what extent they could further improve the overall performance of the WWT plant. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) presents itself as a resistant crop, adapting to the most diverse climatic and soil conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects of nitrogen fertilization in the sunflower crop on the mass of 1000 seeds (M1000S) and the oil content (TOS). The experiment was conducted in the experimental area of the Meteorological Station of the Federal University of Ceará. A randomized block design with five treatments (FN2-two applications, FN4-four applications, FN8-eight applications, FN16-sixteen applications, FN32-thirty two applications of nitrogen) and five replications were used. The results show that the higher the fractionation of the application of N, the greater the M1000S and the TOS. It was concluded that the nitrogen fertilization scheme increased linearly the variables analyzed within the limit of 32 applications. © 2018, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

AB  - Due to climate conditions, the production of vegetables has undergone changes in the production model; vertical cultures are outstanding in the urban community due to the use of small spaces for food production, thus being an alternative to increase productivity in terms of optimization of the space inside the protected environment. The present work aims at analyzing productivity under the influence of solar orientation in vertical vegetables inside the protected environment, combined with localized irrigation technology and vermicompost. The experimental design was completely randomized for the solar orientation factor according to its trajectory (north, south, east, west), with 4 treatments per drum and three repetitions disposed in strips. The cultures used were lettuce, endive, chicory and parsley. The use of vermicompost in the production of vegetables in vertical systems demands detailed research on environmental fertility and the use of vermicompost in the proposed system. The vertical culture technique can be an intelligent and sustainable alternative for production intended for small areas, and can be expanded for cultures in consortiums according to the light preference of each type chosen. © 2018, Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

AB  - The aim of this study was to verify the effects of irrigation and fertirrigation on the wood technological properties of the hybrids of Eucalyptus urograndis (Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis) and Eucalyptus grancam (Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus camaldulensis), aiming at the production of cellulose and charcoal. Analyses were carried out with a completely randomized experimental design, arranged in a factorial scheme with two factors: hybrids (Eucalyptus urograndis and Eucalyptus grancam) and irrigation (fertirrigated microaspersion, microaspersion, fertirrigated drip irrigation, drip irrigation and control treatment). Basic wood density, insoluble lignin content, total extractive content, holocellulose, ashes and morphological characterization of the fibers were analyzed in four trees per hybrid at 45 months. The effect of the interaction hybrid x irrigation was significant at 5% probability for the analyzed variables, with the exception of the insoluble lignin content and the Runkel index. Irrigation and fertirrigation did not influ-ence the basic wood density and the insoluble lignin content of Eucalyptus urograndis. The total extractive content was reduced with the application of fertirrigation. In general, there was no influence of silvicultural treatments on fiber size. Given the results presented, it has been concluded that Eucalyptus grancam presents greater sensitivity to the application of irrigation and fertirrigation, which can be applied to both hybrids, Eucalyptus urograndis and Eucalyptus grancam, without damaging their technological properties. © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

AB  - Urban agriculture is growing in cities and is rising to the roofs of buildings. The potential food contamination is a key issue to be resolved to guarantee the health of consumers, and it affects both urban agriculture promoters and consumers. Crop contamination from the soil can be overcome by adopting a soilless cultivation system that, with good management practices, can also avoid contamination from the fertirrigation system and pest treatments. It has recently increased the number of soilless cultivation systems in cities due to the good features it offers. This study focuses on the potential contamination of heavy metals in hydroponic lettuce crops due to atmospheric pollution in high-traffic areas. The contents of heavy metal in the air and the lettuce leaves were measured at 4 sites: a periurban-integrated rooftop greenhouse, a periurban rooftop, an urban courtyard and an urban rooftop. High-volume sensors were used to assess air contamination. Lettuce leaves were analysed to evaluate the heavy metal concentrations. The results show that the heavy metal concentration in lettuce leaves is also below the EU-legislated limit in all studied cases. Specifically, the concentrations below the detectable analytic values were <0.02 mgNi/kg, <0.008 mgHg/kg, 0.005mgAs/kg and <0.005 mgCd/kg. The Pb concentration ranged from 0.0060 mg/kg to 0.0244 mg/kg. Although the chosen sampling locations were close to high-density roads and they are more vulnerable to a high concentration of metals, in the 4 sampling points heavy metal concentration in the air were less than 50% of the limits established in the legislation as the lower assessment threshold. This study concludes that the heavy metal content in the air of Barcelona is low and is not a source of contamination for urban crops including high traffic areas. © 2018 The Authors

AB  - Sugarcane vinasse has been widely used as a soil fertilizer in the Brazilian sucro-alcohol industry for recycling potassium and water. However, the potential negative effects from long-term soil fertirrigation represent a major drawback regarding this practice, whereas the application of biodigestion represents an efficient method for reducing the polluting organic load and recovering bioenergy from vinasse. Regardless of the predicted use for vinasse, an understanding of the potential of each option is imperative, as the seasonal alterations in the inorganic/organic fractions of vinasse directly affect its management. In this context, this study presents a detailed compositional characterization of sugarcane vinasse from a large-scale Brazilian biorefinery throughout the 2014/2015 harvest to assess the environmental effects (due to fertirrigation) and to estimate the biogas energetic potential. Calculated inputs of organic matter into soils due to vinasse land application were equivalent to the polluting load of populations (117–257 inhab ha−1) at least 2-fold greater than the largest Brazilian capital cities (78–70 inhab ha−1). Two-phase biodigestion could efficiently reduce the polluting load of vinasse (23–52 inhab ha−1) and eliminate the negative effects from direct sulfide emissions in the environment. However, a high risk of soil sodification could result from using high doses of Na-based alkalizing compounds in biodigestion plants. Finally, the optimized recovery of bioenergy through biogas (13.3–26.7 MW as electricity) could supply populations as large as 305 thousand inhabitants, so that over 30% of the surplus electricity produced by the studied biorefinery could be obtained from biogas. Overall, applying biodigestion in the treatment of vinasse provides important environmental and energetic gains. However, the benefits of reducing the polluting organic load of vinasse through bioenergy recovery may lose their effect depending on the alkalizing strategy, indicating that the proper use of chemicals in full-scale biodigestion plants is imperative to attain process sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The gelatin industry wastewater has nutrients in its composition, allowing its use in agriculture as an alternative to disposal and recycling of this residue. However, high application rates can cause the accumulation of elements such as sodium in the soil, and generate negative impacts on the environment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the application of rates up to 600 m3 ha-1of gelatin industry wastewater in soil columns, on soil chemical attributes in five depths. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse, in PVC tube columns (0.20 m diameter) filled with distroferric Red Nitosol soil, of very clayey texture. The treatments consisted of increasing rates of wastewater equivalent to 0, 150, 300, 450 and 600 m3 ha-1, with a single application, at the soil surface and without incorporation. The application of the gelatin industry wastewater resulted no negative effects on soil chemical properties to a depth of 60 cm. The application of the levels of wastewater increased the concentration of sodium in the soil, but without causing problems with sodicity. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agricola.

AB  - In this study, different nitrogen doses (0, 16, 48, 64, 80, and 96 kg ha−1) from two sources, biofertilizer (from anaerobic digestion of cattle wastewater) and urea, were applied to cultivate two sugarcane varieties (RB 867515 and SP 803280). °Brix values higher than 21% were obtained with application of 80 kg ha−1 from biofertilizer. The mean productivity of the cultivar RB 867515 using biofertilizer was 147.5 ton ha−1, while from urea it was 136.87 ton ha−1. The cultivar SP 803280 produced an average yield of 152.25 ton ha−1 when applying biofertilizer and 154.37 ton ha−1 with use of urea. Significant differences (P ≤ 0.05) between the use of biofertilizer and urea were detected for cultivar RB 867515 in terms of crude protein concentration. The application of 80 kg of N ha−1 was considered the ideal dose, corresponding to fertirrigation blades of 54 mm of biofertilizer. The experiment showed that the biofertilizer formulation analyzed can replace urea as a nitrogen source for growing sugarcane.

AB  - The fluctuation in the price of oil and the positive consequences of fuels from renewable sources (compared to fossil fuels) propel the expansion of biofuel global production. In this work, the current distillation operation of an ethanol distillery is simulated and compared to the use of indirect heating, evaluating the environmental and economic impacts associated with vinasse fertirrigation by using an external automated tool. Results show that the replacement proposed decreases approximately 15% of the amount of vinasse. Moreover, as the modifications do not change the outlet flowrates, such revamping might be done without additional operational changes that could affect the productivity. The environmental evaluation presents positive results, showing that the new configuration may decrease all environmental impacts categories assessed. From an economic perspective, the plant could also have higher profits, presenting a payback period of 3.57 years. Finally, the new improved system is treated as a multi-objective optimization problem and it is solved by using the weighted sum method to obtain the Pareto frontier, providing the optimal solutions that trade-off economic and environmental objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to evaluate the quality of the effluent treated by the overland flow system in ramps cultivated with forages, by means of the proposal of a quality index adapted for fertirrigation and grouping as to the similarity of the chemical characteristics using Multivariate Statistics an experiment was carried out mounted on a Completely randomized design and in the subdivided 3x3 plot scheme with 5 replicates. The plots were composed of forages at three levels: Azevém, Capim Marandu and a mixed system composed of the two species; and the sub-plots composed of three effluent rates: 2.25; 4.5 and 6.75 L h-1. The quality index was developed using the principal components analysis, which provided a reduction of the 25 characteristics analyzed in the effluents in three components that explained 94.95% of the total variance. The quality index for the treated effluent presented a moderate restriction to the use in fertirrigation and the effluent of septic tanks presented severe restriction, and the clustering analysis formed two distinct quality groups, which differed in effluent from septic tank and treated effluent. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana 1.

AB  - Moringa oleifera has an exceptional composition in nutrients and different medicinal compounds. Phenolic compounds present in Moringa plant could prevent chronic non-communicable diseases. An increase in the secondary metabolites of Moringa oleifera could improve its functional properties. One possible strategy to increase functional properties in plants is to cultivate them under fertilizer deficit regimes as elicitation treatment (i.e: nitrogen). The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of four nitrogen levels on the phenolic compounds profiles as well as on plant growth and functional properties in Moringa oleifera leaves. Total phenols and flavonoids, antioxidant and bactericidal activities of Moringa oleifera leaves extracts were evaluated. Our results displayed that reduce fertirrigation until 0.7 mg/L of N-NO3 (T0) had a positive impact on total phenols and flavonoids with 355 ± 4.9 μg CA/mg dry extract and 316 ± 8 μg Q/mg dry extract respectively, whereas the fertirrigation with 294.7 mg/L of N-NO3 (T100) It was found only 157 ± 8.1 μg CA/mg dry extract and 54 ± 0.1 μg Q/mg dry extract respectively. The higher values of phenolic content were improved the antioxidant activity and antibacterial properties of Moringa oleifera leaves extracts, nevertheless plant growth was affected. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The netted melon requires special growing conditions, including a protected environment, an adequate staking system and proper water and nutrient management. This study aimed to assess the effect of irrigation levels and silicon doses on the yield and quality of Sunrise hybrid melons, in a greenhouse. A randomized block design was used, with a 5 x 3 factorial scheme and four replications. The first factor consisted of five silicon doses (0 kg ha-1, 50 kg ha-1, 100 kg ha-1, 150 kg ha-1 and 200 kg ha-1) and the second of three irrigation levels (40 %, 70 % and 100 % of the ETc). The results demonstrated that the applied irrigation levels and silicon doses have no influence on the yield traits of melon plants. The irrigation level corresponding to 100 % of the ETc promotes higher values for soluble solids (9.86 ºBrix) and maturation index (114.9) on fruits. The increase of silicon doses up to 200 kg ha-1 also increases the maturation index in the treatment with the greatest irrigation level and reduces this index at the shallowest level applied. © 2018, Universidade Federal De Goias (UFG).

AB  - Knowing the rooting optimum time reduces the potential for diseases and optimizes the use of greenhouse and shade. The aim of this study was to determine rooting period of the hybrid clone of cuttings of Eucalyptus urophylla S.T. Blake and Eucalyptus grandis W. Hill ex Maiden in the greenhouse and shade from different water irrigation level managements applied in minigardens and with two levels of foliar reduction in the minicuttings. The experiment was conducted in the nursery of the Sada Bio Energy and Agriculture Company, Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design in factorial arrangement, consisting of seven irrigation management and reduced levels of two leaves (with and without reduction). The treatments were defined according to the daily reading of the Class A tank (T1 = 50% ET0-single frequency, T2 = 75% ET0-twice a day, T3 = 100% ET0-twice a day, T4 = 125% ET0-three times a day, T5 = 150% ET0-three times a day, T6 = 100% ET0-often single-T7 and the company operating Blade-10.66 mm day-1, eight fertirrigation times a day for five minutes with a flow rate of 0.8 l h-1). They were assessed at ages 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 days, the variables dry mass of minicuttings, root and total. The water irrigation level 2.19 mm / day-1 (T2) without foliar reduction showed the shortest the rooting time. The treatment without foliar reduction provided the minimizing of rooting time for all irrigation level managements (blades). © 2018, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

AB  - The northeastern semiarid region faces some of the droughts of the last centuries, resulting in serious reductions of agriculture yields. The water scarcity for agricultural requires rational use practices and reuse of water, such as use of domestic effluent sewage. Alternatively, the use of treated domestic sewage effluent utilizing for irrigation of forage species, such as the forage cactus, can be highlighted. In order to evaluate the effects of fertirrigation with treated sewage effluent on mineral nutrient composition of forage cactus (Opuntia Tuna L. Mill, Mexican elephant ear), an experiment was carried out utilizing a split plot 3 x (4 + 1) with a randomized complete block design randomized block and four replications, being three planting density (66,667.00, 52,282.00 and 33,333.00 plants ha-1) and two water sources associated with irrigation frequency of plates fixed on 3.5 mm per irrigation (Frequencies of 2.3 days with water tap and 7, 14 and 21 days with Sewage Effluent) and cactus cultivated in Rainfed agriculture rainfed (control). The analyze of the nutritional contents of cladodes indicated that there was a significant effect of the intervals from irrigation events only for Ca and Mg concentrations. The highest levels of Ca and Mg were found with the irrigation frequency of 2.3 using tap water. The macronutrients concentration in greater quantity by the forage cactus were N e, K followed by, Ca, Mg and P. The nutritional balance indicated excess of K and P and deficiency of N, Ca and Mg, in this order. © 2018, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arid. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persimmon cultivation is gaining importance in many semi-arid areas of the world. This is the case of eastern Spain, where the rainfall regime is well below the crop water needs, and drip irrigation is typically used to control the water and nutrient supplies. This review is a summary of the current information in the literature on persimmon water and nutrient requirements. Crop responses to variable irrigation regimes and mild to severe water stress are also analyzed. It is concluded that persimmon water needs can be particularly high during summer, when the crop coefficient can reach values close or even above 1.0. In order to cope with water scarcity, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) has been shown as a useful technique for reducing fruit drop in persimmon trees. RDI strategies during fruit ripening can accelerate fruit color development, resulting in earlier harvesting but with lower fruit weight. Information on nutrients requirement of astringent and non-astringent varieties of persimmon is also provided. Finally, new research for continuing plant-water relations studies on persimmon trees, such as the need to quantify the optimum nutrition plans under conditions of variable water supply, will be proposed. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Background: The production of 1 L of ethanol from sugarcane generates up to 12 L of vinasse, which is a liquid waste containing an as-yet uncharacterized microbial assemblage. Most vinasse is destined for use as a fertilizer on the sugarcane fields because of the high organic and K content; however, increased N2O emissions have been observed when vinasse is co-applied with inorganic N fertilizers. Here we aimed to characterize the microbial assemblage of vinasse to determine the gene potential of vinasse microbes for contributing to negative environmental effects during fertirrigation and/or to the obstruction of bioethanol fermentation. Results: We measured chemical characteristics and extracted total DNA from six vinasse batches taken over 1.5 years from a bioethanol and sugar mill in Sao Paulo State. The vinasse microbial assemblage was characterized by low alpha diversity with 5-15 species across the six vinasses. The core genus was Lactobacillus. The top six represented bacterial genera across the samples were Lactobacillus, Megasphaera and Mitsuokella (Phylum Firmicutes, 35-97% of sample reads); Arcobacter and Alcaligenes (Phylum Proteobacteria, 0-40%); Dysgonomonas (Phylum Bacteroidetes, 0-53%); and Bifidobacterium (Phylum Actinobacteria, 0-18%). Potential genes for denitrification but not nitrification were identified in the vinasse metagenomes, with putative nirK and nosZ genes the most represented. Binning resulted in 38 large bins with between 36.0 and 99.3% completeness, and five small mobile element bins. Of the large bins, 53% could be classified at the phylum level as Firmicutes, 15% as Proteobacteria, 13% as unknown phyla, 13% as Bacteroidetes and 6% as Actinobacteria. The large bins spanned a range of potential denitrifiers; moreover, the genetic repertoires of all the large bins included the presence of genes involved in acetate, CO2, ethanol, H2O2, and lactose metabolism; for many of the large bins, genes related to the metabolism of mannitol, xylose, butyric acid, cellulose, sucrose, "3-hydroxy" fatty acids and antibiotic resistance were present based on the annotations. In total, 21 vinasse bacterial draft genomes were submitted to the genome repository. Conclusions: Identification of the gene repertoires of vinasse bacteria and assemblages supported the idea that organic carbon and nitrogen present in vinasse together with microbiological variation of vinasse might lead to varying patterns of N2O emissions during fertirrigation. Furthermore, we uncovered draft genomes of novel strains of known bioethanol contaminants, as well as draft genomes unknown at the phylum level. This study will aid efforts to improve bioethanol production efficiency and sugarcane agriculture sustainability. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Vinasse is the main liquid effluent of ethanol distillation and, since it can cause damages in water and soil resources, different solutions have been proposed to correctly dispose this wastewater. The use as fertilizer in sugarcane irrigation, called fertirrigation, is the main alternative practiced in Brazilian distilleries and it can be enhanced with vinasse concentration and/or biogas production by anaerobic digestion (AD). However, few studies have evaluated the performance of those systems and their combination in order to compare and improve the efficiency of vinasse treatment. Thus, an exergy analysis comparing five combinations of fertirrigation, vinasse concentration and anaerobic digestion, including power generation from biogas, was performed using a thermodynamic model and the Anaerobic Digestion Model Nº1 developed in Aspen Plus and Matlab. The highest exergy efficiency of 27.9% was attained for an average distillery with an AD power plant concentrating digested vinasse. This case performed better than others because all vinasse was treated and part of vinasse water exergy was recovered in the concentration process. Furthermore, the heat integration between AD power plant and vinasse concentration increased the exergy efficiency of those processes in 9-23% and reduced steam consumption in 12-25%. For all cases, fertirrigation was the main source of irreversibilities due to the organic substances exergy losses, while anaerobic digestion reduced the total exergy destroyed. © 2018 University of Minho.

AB  - Camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia (Kunth) McVaugh) is a native fruit tree, which is in domestication process, therefore, knowledge of nutritional needs is essential to improve the fertilization efficiency throughout plant development. The aim of this research was to determine the nutrient content of camu-camu plants as a function of nitrogen fertilization via fertirrigation in the first year of cultivation. An experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design, with 5 treatments as follows: 0; 40; 80; 120 and 160 kg.ha-1 of N, eight replicates and seven plants per experimental unit. The evaluated variables were as follows: Total dry matter and nutrient contents in camu-camu leaves. The results show total dry matter of camu-camu plants, which were performed a significant quadratic behavior in response to increasing N doses. In Fact, N doses greater than 128 kg.ha-1 aroused a depressive effects. In addition, leaf contents of N, K, and Ca, had achieved a significant quadratic response and highest concentrations were recorded between 113 and 115 kg of N.ha-1. On the other hand, micronutrients had a polynomial depressive behavior according to an increasing N doses. It can be concluded that nutrient foliar contents are adequate for the camu-camu plants development. In fact, N, Ca, K, Fe, Mn and B, were the most required nutrients. Micronutrients determined in leaves, corresponded to the following decreasing order: N&gt; Ca&gt; K&gt; Mg&gt; S&gt; P&gt; Mn&gt; Fe&gt; B&gt; Zn&gt; Cu, respectively.

AB  - Fertigation of agricultural crops using raw domestic sewage (RDS) has proven to be an excellent choice as opposed to conventional treatment. In this context, this work’spurpose was to evaluate the characteristics of the RDS to be applied in elephant grass fertirrigation as to its possible nutrients and pollutants. RDS was submitted to chemical (pH, COD, BOD5, Na, macronutrients and micronutrients) and physical (EC, TS, TFS and TVS) laboratory analyzes. Sodium was the referential chemical element for the definition of the RDS’s sheet to be applied to the ground, which was 215 mm of RDS at 26 cultivation weeks. NTK and P concentrations in RDS were 137 and 19.9 mg L-1, corresponding to the applied load of 296 and 43.9 kg ha-1 respectively, values that can be considered high. Furthermore, the mean concentrations of BOD5 and COD were 433 and 743 mg L-1 respectively, which leads to a COD/BOD5 ratio of 1,7, signaling a high biodegradability of organic matter in the RDS, indicative of good quality for agricultural purposes. Based on the applied sheet, it can be concluded that the RDS provided the availability of sufficient quantities of nutrients, ensuring good conditions for forage grass development. © 2018.

AB  - Considering the significant expenses with fertilizer and irrigation, the use of wastewater in fertirrigation has been studied as an alternative, since it can supply part of the water demand and provide nutrients to the plants. The objective of this work was to evaluate the changes in soil nutrient/pollutant contents, with successive applications of Domestic Sewage. Two treatments were implanted, one of them without alternation and another with alternation in the direction of the flow. Chemical and physicochemical analyzes of soil in the superficial layer were made in samples collected after 10 and 26 weeks from the beginning of application. According to the results, there was an increase in the Total Nitrogen, Sodium content available and in the electrical conductivity values, but a decrease in Potassium, Organic Matter and pH values. Although Total Nitrogen levels increased, they remained below the limit of risk. Potassium reduction can be explained by the high mobility in the soil and the absorption of plants. However, the reduction in the content of organic matter and in the pH value is due to the effect of the nutrient supply, which favored the degradation of the native organic matter of the soil. © 2018.

AB  - This chapter evaluates the N transformations in calcareous soil after a pig slurry application in order to propose measures to reduce the leaching of certain nitrogen compounds. For this purpose, nine undisturbed soil columns were amended with unprocessed pig slurry using three doses (i.e., 0, 170 (LD) and 510 (HD)kg Nha1). Electrical conductivity of leachates ranged from 0.23 to 1.51dSm?1; pH showed values of 7.00-8.30, and NH4+-N content was always 1mgL1. In the amended soils, there were N volatilization losses &gt;l1gm2 and nitrification profits &gt;5000mgm2 due to the mineralization of organic nitrogen and the oxidation of NH4+ as a consequence of biological activity. The net balance in the columns showed N losses (volatilization and denitrification) from soil, being favored by high soil pH, CaCO3 content, high concentrations of NH4+ and organic compounds in the pig slurry, high temperatures, and leaching events by rainfall simulation. In the end, 85% of the initial total N provided by PS was lost from soil for LD and HD, mainly by volatilization or denitrification. Similarly for both doses, the percentage of the initial total N lost by leaching was very low (~4%). The high dose showed gains of NO31-N and losses of NH4+-N and organic N, only slightly higher than the low dose. The highest N losses in the amended soil occured in weeks 3-11 after the pig slurry application; during this period a conscious environmental management of the soil-water-plant system is essential to avoid N losses by adding nitrification inhibitors and scheduling nutrient uptake and fertirrigation. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
