AB  - A probable strategy for increasing the economic sustainability of algal technology would involve the utilization of microalgal biomass as biofertilizer by off-setting the high production costs. The present study focusses on the utilization of mixed algal consortia as biofertilizer for analysing the growth rate of tomato plant. Algal extracts (20-100%) in the form of seed primer and foliar spray were used as biostimulants for the growth of tomato plant. Characterization of algal consortium showed the presence of 40.90% carbohydrates and 26.18% proteins that could potentially act as precursors for bioactive compounds to stimulate plant growth. Faster germination percentage was found with extract concentrations ranging from 20-60% in 3 days compared to the untreated seeds. Seeds treated with cellular extracts of 40% concentration also showed faster plant growth rate after sowing in terms of increase in shoot length 19.86 ± 0.51 cm and root length of 14.87 ± 0.63 cm with a fresh and dry weight of 3.47 ± 0.04 g and 0.389 ± 0.036 g respectively after 20 days. Foliar spraying of 60% algal extracts resulted in total plant height of 7.98 ± 0.19 cm with root length of 5.8 ± 0.16 cm, 46% higher compared to the control. 11 ± 0.35 leaves with chlorophyll content of 13.45 ± 0.307 mg g-1 were also obtained after 20 days, with fresh and dry biomass content of 0.416 ± 0.015 g and 0.062 ± 0.005 g respectively. Thus, microalgal cellular extracts could act as an environmental-friendly and economical alternative to synthetic liquid fertilizer for promoting sustainable agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nowadays, the extensive use of inorganic fertilizers has increased the salinity of soil and decreased optimal assimilation of nutrients by crops. Organic carbon is basic for controlling the nutrient level in soil and nutrient assimilation by plants. The objective of this study was to develop a process for recovering organic carbon using compost from mixed municipal waste as raw material. The use of fertilizers from organic residues could replace mineral fertilizers, contributing to resources preservation and recycling of organic matter. In this way, a Taguchi experimental design was proposed to select the most suitable operating conditions for recovering organic carbon from the organic residue. The variable factors were the solid:liquid ratio, type of solvent, extraction time, and particle size. The optimum extraction conditions were: solid:liquid ratio 1:2.5, 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH), 72 h, and particle size > 1 mm. Subsequent experiments concluded that separating the mixed municipal waste compost (MMWC) by fractions of different particle sizes before extraction process is not recommended. Under these conditions, the total organic carbon concentration in the extract was 6.9% w/w, of which the content of humic acids was 47.6%. On the other hand, the extract complies with the legal requirements of Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 for fertilizing products regarding composition. Germination tests were carried out to analyze the phytotoxic effects of organic extracts. Finally, a preliminary economic study showed the viability for a production plant with a capacity of 300 kg/h of MMWC. The production of liquid fertilizer was 200 L per 100 kg of dry compost, and the estimated sale price to obtain economic benefits was 1 €/L of fertilizer for a plant whose total investment cost was 1,600 k€. © 2020

AB  - Anaerobically digested slurry (ADS) has been widely used as a liquid fertilizer in agroecosystems. However, there is scant information on the effects of successive ADS applications on heavy metals (HMs) accumulation and fungal community composition in paddy soils. In this study, we conducted a field experiment over 10 years to assess the changes in soil HMs and fungal community composition under the long-term application of ADS in a paddy field. The four treatments were (1) no fertilizer (CK); (2) mineral fertilizer and 270 kg N ha−1 from urea (MF); (3) 270 kg N ha−1 from ADS (ADS1); and (4) 540 kg N ha−1 from ADS (ADS2). The results revealed that ADS application improved paddy soil fertility compared to that under the MF treatment by increasing soil organic C (SOC), total N (TN) and available potassium (AK). Long-term application of ADS significantly increased soil total and available Zn (TZn and AZn) concentrations as compared to those under the MF treatment. However, there were no significant differences in the total and available Cu concentrations or the total Pb concentration between the ADS and MF treatments. Sequence analysis showed that application of ADS increased the fungal richness indexes (Chao1 and ACE) compared to MF treatment. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that the soil fungal community compositions were significantly separated by high levels of ADS application. Long-term application of ADS increased the relative abundance of classes Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes and Agaricomycetes by 20.8–29.0%, 107.3–141.4% and 289.5–387.5%, respectively, but decreased that of Pezizomycetes by 14.0–33.0% compared to that under the MF treatment. At the genus level, compared to those under the MF treatment, the relative abundances of Pyrenochaetopsis and Myrothecium were significantly increased by the application of ADS, but those of Mrakia and Tetracladium were significantly decreased. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that SOC, AZn and AP were the three most important factors affecting the fungal community composition of the paddy soil. Our findings suggested that fungal community composition could be affected by changes in the chemical properties and heavy metal contents of paddy soil under high application of ADS in the long term. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The authors investigated whether biogas digestate could be used as a nutrient solution for rockwool culture. To do this, the authors examined growth performances of chrysanthemum cultured in rockwool and fed the filtrate of nitrified biogas digestate (f-NBD) derived from organic fraction of municipal solid waste and investigated whether application of the digestate caused nutrients to leach from the rockwool substrate. Plants that had been fed the f-NBD showed 33% lower fresh shoot weights and produced 35% fewer flowers than those that had been fed a commercial liquid fertilizer, whereas there were no significant differences in lengths of the shoots, chlorophyll contents of the leaves, numbers of days to first flowering, and maximum diameters of the flowers. Also, there were no significant differences in any of the growth parameters between plants that were cultured with the f-NBD supplemented with Mg and the commercial liquid fertilizer. These results indicate that the f-NBD could be used as a nutrient solution for chrysanthemum in rockwool culture if supplemented with Mg. In addition, a considerable amount of Fe was leached from the rockwool substrates following the application of the f-NBD, which could mitigate the expected Fe-deficiency symptoms in chrysanthemum. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Landfill leachate is high-strength wastewater containing harmful pollutants and very rich in ammonia (NH3), an undesired element in wastewaters. NH3 is used as a liquid fertilizer in agriculture and as a reactant in many other fields. The present study investigated the reclamation of NH3 during the treatment of middle-age landfill leachate by direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) 0.45 µm pore size membranes. Synthetic and real wastewaters were used during the study. pH, temperature and salt content of the solution highly affected the reclamation efficiency of NH3. Low reclamation of NH3 from the real leachate was reported compared to synthetic solutions, due to the solution characteristic. With low salinity, high salinity synthetic solution and real landfill leachate as feed solutions heated to 60 °C, the reclamation efficiency of NH3 by PTFE membrane, determined as the best membrane in this study, was 81.1%, 97.6% and 58.4, respectively. The autopsy of the PTFE membrane by SEM analysis, FTIR and contact angle, after 72 h operation showed very little damage to the membrane but depicted the deposition of some particles on the membrane surface, causing the flux to drop from 12.7 to 11.9 L/m2 h. © 2020, Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Zinc (Zn) is a limiting nutrient in soils for both plant yield and Zn nutrition. Soil Zn deficiency can be corrected by the application of Zn fertilisers. Novel formulations of Zn fertiliser are being developed using loaded graphene oxide (GO) sheets, but plant trials are limited. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) and Medicago (Medicago truncatula) plants were grown with and without inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Rhizophagus irregularis, in a substrate either unamended or amended with one of four different Zn fertilisers, including three Zn-GO formulations. The Zn-GO fertiliser was applied in granular, powder, and liquid forms, and the ZnSO4 applied as a solution; all fertilisers were added to 10 mg Zn kg− 1 substrate. Plants were grown to maturity and measurements of biomass and Zn nutrition taken. A Zn-GO liquid fertiliser conferred greater biomass than the unamended control in both plant species, while a Zn-GO powdered fertiliser conferred greater Zn uptake in both species. Mycorrhizal Medicago plants had greater Zn uptake with Zn-GO powder than when mock-inoculated. Medicago was highly growth responsive to the AMF and this had a much larger effect than Zn fertiliser. Barley Zn nutrition was improved much more than yield by the addition of Zn fertiliser. The Zn-GO formulations show promise for delivery of Zn to two contrasting agriculturally important crops, with improvements in biomass accumulation and Zn nutrition achieved with at least one GO formulation in both crops. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine the influence of liquid fertiliser that comes from the waste of dairy farms for soil quality and vegetative growth of coffee plants. There are three kinds of fertilization intensity (treatment) that is without fertilization (K0), one-times fertilization (C1) and two-times fertilisation (C2). The results were analysed using Group Randomized Design as experimental design; ANOVA and Tukey Test 5% as analysis method. The results showed that the treatment affects soil quality. The treatment also gives a significant influence (p &lt; 0.05) at the height rate of coffee plants in the 2nd week and the canopy diameter rate of coffee plant in the 2nd and 4th week. The results of this research are expected to provide input especially for cattle farmers and coffee planters who want to integrate their livestock and their crops. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Considering the problems, namely crops damage, large hole width and low fertilizer spraying efficiency of deep application-type liquid fertilizer hole applicator, a deep application-type inclined liquid fertilizer hole applicator was designed. Through the design of "oblique hole pricking and parameter reverse solution", and based on the human-computer interaction platform, the pricking hole mechanism of key components was designed, the structure and working parameters of the mechanism were optimized, and the movement form of fertilizer feeding interface of fertilizer spraying needle was analyzed. According to the technical characteristics of spraying fertilizer needle earthing and unearthing fertilizer, and to improve the efficiency of fertilizer delivery, the liquid fertilizer distribution mechanism, which was the key component, was designed by using the combined transmission form of "differential gear train transmission and space cam mechanism". The movement model of the fertilizer outlet interface was constructed to analyze and satisfy the cooperative movement mechanism with the fertilizer inlet interface and reduce the complicated connection configuration of the fertilizer delivery pipeline. The field performance test of the deep application-type inclined liquid fertilizer hole applicator revealed a superior hole punching performance, the fertilizer was sprayed evenly, and the mechanical damage to crops was small. The hole width, crop damage rate, fertilization amount and fertilization depth were 45.0 mm, 0.3%, 28.5 mL/time and 102 mm, respectively. All indexes were less different from the previous design and met the agronomic requirements. © 2020, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery. All right reserved.

AB  - Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to directly obtain the three-dimensional resistance variation law and soil dynamic behavior characteristics of the soil contact component-needle body through experiments when the liquid fertilizer hole applicator is pricked with the inclined pricking hole mechanism. By adopting the Drucker-Prager yield criterion to construct the finite element model of hole application soil, the ADAMS kinematics analysis module was applied to obtain the pricking hole track of fertilizer spraying needle of pricking hole mechanism, and ANSYS/LS-DYNA display dynamics software was used to establish the interaction simulation model between fertilizer spraying needle and soil. Taking the maximum pressure on the needle body in the Z-axis direction as the measurement index and the working parameters as the influencing factors, the virtual and bench comparative tests of single way stress on the fertilizer spraying needle were carried out. The results revealed that the pressure was increased first and then decreased with the increase of the advancing speed and the rotation of puncture speed. The simulation and test data were close in size and the change trend was basically the same. Taking the advance speed of the fertilizer spraying needle (0.62 m/s), the rotation speed of the puncture hole (70 r/min) and the inclined angle (20°) as the simulation working parameters, the three-dimensional resistance of the needle body and the dynamic behavior of the soil were simulated and analyzed. The analysis disclosed that the resistance of the fertilizer spraying needle in the three directions was increased first and then decreased. Within 0~0.189 s, the process of the fertilizer spraying needle entering the soil, the resistance of the needle body was changed slowly in the X-axis direction, indicating that the fertilizer spraying disturbed less to the soil in the advancing direction. The resistance of the needle body was increased rapidly in the Z-axis direction, which indicated that the fertilizer spraying needle had a strong impact on the soil. The stress of the soil was mainly concentrated in this direction due to the shear of the needle tip, and the resistance reached the maximum value of 21.69 N at 0.189 s. The resistance of the needle body in the Y-axis direction was small, which indicated that the squeezing effect of the fertilizer spraying needle on the soil was weak, and the resistance reached the maximum value of 8.56 N at 0.189 s. Within 0.189~0.214 s, the original position of the fertilizer spraying needle swung itself, the resistance of the needle body was increased rapidly in the X-axis direction, which indicated that fertilizer spraying needle triggered great disturbance to the soil in the advancing direction. The resistance values in the other two directions remained basically unchanged. Within 0.214~0.350 s, the excavation of the fertilizer spraying needle, the resistance of the needle in the Z-axis and Y-axis directions were gradually decreased until it became zero. Among them, within 0.214~0.238 s, the resistance of the needle body in the X-axis direction was increased instantly, indicating that fertilizer spraying produced strong extrusion on the soil in the forward direction, reaching the maximum value of 31.87 N at 0.238 s. During the whole pricking process, the formation of the puncture opening was mainly caused by the swing posture of the fertilizer spraying needle itself and the soil disturbance in the forward direction during the excavation process. Therefore, the resistance of the needle body along the X-axis direction was influenced significantly, which conformed to the actual pricking hole law. The simulation method of needle-soil interaction provided can be a reference for the optimization design of fertilizer spraying needle and the research of clay characteristics. © 2020, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - Drought tolerant sorghum varieties cultivation on dryland areas is one of the potential sources of plant biomass to be used for bioethanol production. East Nusa Tenggara which has a short month of rainfall and mainly consists of drought-prone areas is suitable for sorghum to thrive where most other food crops simply withered. Eleven sorghum genotypes were evaluated on the dry land of East Flores in East Nusa Tenggara with treatment in the different applications of organic liquid fertilizer. Results showed that genotypes values were significantly different in all traits observed, and the interaction factors between fertilizer and genotypes had a significant effect on all traits except panicle length and width. The application of liquid organic fertilizer, however, did not significantly affect traits in both plant and stem biomass. Super 2 genotype showed the highest stem biomass value and differed significantly compared to other genotypes, even though fertilized treatment obtained less yield (29.87 t.ha-1) compared to without fertilizer (44.11 t.ha-1). Pearson correlation between all observed traits showed that stem biomass was significantly highly correlated to various traits, such as number of internodes (r = 0.77), plant height (r = 0.74), stem diameter (r = 0.72), and plant biomass weight (r = 0.97). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The results of biomethanization process are biogas and slurry. The process of forming conventional biogas with cow feces input has a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30 days. In this study, an innovation was carried out by adding new bioactivator with the aim decomposition on input occur optimally and quickly. HRT of one week was showed good and stable gas production than controls. It is assumed that if the gas has stabilized, the slurry has undergone decomposition in which the slurry is a liquid fertilizer ready to use. The study design was a completely randomized design with three treatments as follows: (1) T1: control without an additional bioactivator; (2) T2: addition of biactivator 1%; and (3) T3: addition of bioactivator 2%. Bioactivator was made from waste bananas, papayas and pineapples with an additional of chicken intestines. Addition of chicken intestine was done because the bacteria in the chicken intestine are known very effective at work. The parameters measured were pH, C-Organic, N-Total, P2O5 and K2O. The results showed that T3 had characteristics as slurries which awee better than T2 or T1. This means that an additional of bioactivators cause good slurry quality even though HRT is only 1 week. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The goal of this study was to establish a system for co-culturing microalgae and crop plants with biogas digestate. We examined growth performances of E. gracilis and L. sativa co-cultured using a commercial liquid fertilizer designed for soilless culture supplemented with vitamins and ammonium. This solution simulated the filtrate of nitrified biogas digestate derived from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste but was supplemented with insufficient plant nutrients (Mg, Fe and Mn). The specific growth rate of the co-cultured E. gracilis was 0.761 ± 0.081 d−1 (mean ± SE), which was the same rate that E. gracilis achieved when grown as a sole culture. There were no significant differences between L. sativa cultured with E. gracilis until the stationary growth phase of E. gracilis was reached and those cultured alone relative to biomass, RGRs (relative growth rates), or relative to SPAD values of leaves. These results suggest that E. gracilis and L. sativa could be co-cultured with the biogas digestate after being nitrified and filtered. In addition, considering concentrations of plant macronutrients in the residual solution after the co-culturing E. gracilis and L. sativa, it could be re-used as the nutrient solution for co-culturing E. gracilis and L. sativa. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There is a continuing need for accurate estimates of ammonia emission during livestock liquid fertilizer spreading. The objective of this study was to evaluate and confirm the chamber-capture system for estimating the flux of ammonia from the liquid fertilizer. Using manufactured dynamic chamber-capture system (DCS), artificial liquid fertilizer (ALF), and livestock liquid fertilizer (LLF), the ammonia emission flux (mg m−2 h−1) and total accumulated ammonia emission (mg m−2) were estimated over time. DCS showed stable gas capture and quantitation over a range of 300 to 2500 mg-N L−1 for total ammoniacal nitrogen. Ammonia emission flux directly emitted from the ALF and LLF solution was initially highest and rapidly decreased. When applied to granite weathered soil, both ALF and LLF stabilized faster, resulting in the lower emission flux and total amount. Through 7 days of long-term continuous monitoring, it has been confirmed that ammonia was emitted quickly and a lot in the early stages. These results indicate that DCS could be used for ammonia emission flux studies for identifying the mechanism of ammonia emission by interaction with various characteristics of liquid fertilizer and soil. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control

AB  - The accumulation of ammonia in water bodies can cause eutrophication and reduce water quality. Furthermore, 80% of the ammonia in the world is consumed as fertilizer, which makes it a resource that can be recovered under the circular economy concept. Then, ammonia from wastewater can be valorised for agricultural applications. Liquid-liquid membrane contactors (LLMCs) have been postulated as a novel and eco-friendly technology for ammonia recovery, because they can convert dissolved ammonia into ammonium salts by an acid stripping solution. The concentration of the ammonium salt produced is limited by the co-transport of water in LLMC. Further concentration by electrodialysis (ED) is presented as a solution to overcome this problem. In this work, ammonia streams with different initial ammonia concentrations (1.7–4.0 g/L) were treated by LLMCs to produce liquid ammonium salt fertilizers (as NH4NO3 and NH4H2PO4). Then, these ammonium solutions were concentrated by ED in order to achieve the nitrogen content required for direct application in agriculture for fertigation. After the LLMC process, the fertilizer obtained was composed of approximately 5.1% or 10.1% (w/w) nitrogen, depending on the initial ammonia concentration. After that, it was possible to concentrate these ammonium salts by a factor of 1.6 ± 0.3 using ED with an optimal energy consumption of 0.21 ± 0.08 kWh/kg ammonium salt and 93.1 ± 4.2% of faradaic yield. This gave a liquid fertilizer composed of 15.6% (w/w) nitrogen as NH4NO3. Overall, it was possible to integrate two innovative membrane technologies for the valorisation and concentration of nutrients from ammonia wastewater streams. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An automatic stirring system based on temperature control has been successfully installed in a composter barrel. Composter with a 30 litres plastic barrel model was used to process organic waste into organic liquid fertilizer. The system worked by measuring temperature and controlling temperature. Function of temperature control to perform automatic stirring commands. To do this, the Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller is used as a system controller and SHT 11 sensor to detect the temperature and humidity of the composter chamber. Testing is done by measuring temperature continuously with DAQ based data acquisition methods. Stirring will work when the temperature matches the composter processing range. From the test results it was found that the temperature and the automatic stirring system worked well. From the test results it was found that the temperature and automatic stirring system had worked well and were successfully controlled when the temperature reached 50 °C so that stirring worked automatically. The ability to maintain temperature in the composter chamber is very important because it maintains the air cycle in the composter chamber. Thus, the composter with an automatic stirring system based on the temperature control produced in this study has offered a practical method for processing organic liquid fertilizer. © 2020 Author(s).

AB  - To improve the efficiency of liquid fertilizer application, a variable liquid fertilizer applicator for deep-fertilization based on ZigBee technology was elaborated. A host computer with remote control software and a STM32F103RET6 microcontroller were combined to measure and control the li-quid fertilizer output. Through the ZigBee wireless communication network, this system realized the collection of liquid flow information in real time using flow meter while monitoring the liquid level, and an incremental PID control algorithm was used to dynamically adjust the converter frequency for reaching the set liquid fertilizer flow accurately. In the meanwhile, the performance experiment in the field analyzed and compared how parameters like the fertilizer application depth, the converter frequency, the fertilization pressure and the opening degree of back-water valve influenced the accuracy and the stabi-lity of the liquid variable deep-fertilization control. On the basis of the test data, a precise flow control mathematical model was also established. As the result, the orchard experiments indicated: the applicator accuracy is able to reach 99.52% and the maximum liquid fertilizer consumption in each fertilization process is 0.22 L /min; with the fertilizer application depth changing, the maximum flow output difference is 0.15 L /min and the converter frequency difference is 0.79 Hz. When adjusting the opening degree of back-water valve to confirm the optimum working parameters, which means the valve opening degree is 40%, the system works the most stably while owns the minor flow output difference and the low liquid fertilizer consumption. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Drainage and Irrigation Machinery Engineering.

AB  - Two dahlia (Dahlia × hybrida) cultivars were grown with one of five constant liquid fertilizer concentrations (75, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg L-1 N) using a 13N-0.86P-10.8K fertilizer. The cultivars used were 'Hypnotica Cherish Pink' and 'Goldalia Scarlet'. Tissue samples were collected and analyzed for foliar nutrient concentrations at two different times. At each harvest date, plant height, plant diameter, and shoot dry mass were recorded. Dahlias achieved maximum growth when grown with 100 to 300 mg L-1 N, while 400 mg L-1 N was detrimental. Foliar nutrient sufficiency ranges were determined based on fertilizer concentrations resulting in maximum growth. These results provide improved dahlia fertilization recommendations and foliar sufficiency ranges. © 2020 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - To manage nitrogen (N) efficiently, organic growers must be able to predict the amount and timing of plant-available N from organic amendments. In this study, we measured N mineralization from a variety of organic amendments, including composted animal manures and plant material, pelleted and granular organic fertilizer formulations, slaughter waste products, and hydrolyzed liquid fertilizers. In a laboratory incubation, we measured net N mineralization from materials mixed with either organically or conventionally managed soil at 23°C and 60% water holding capacity after 0, 7, 21, 42, and 84 d. We found that net mineral N change in the amended soils after 84 d of incubation fell into four categories: immobilization to 5% of applied N for yard trimmings composts, 15–30% for poultry manure composts, 35–55% for granular fertilizers, and 60–90% for quick release products. However, across all amendments the amount of plant-available N after 84 d of incubation was well correlated with the carbon (C)/N ratio (R2 = 0.92). Within amendment types, the C/N ratio predicted N mineralization for yard trimmings composts (R2 = 0.91), manure composts (R2 = 0.81), and specialty fertilizer and slaughter products (R2 = 0.88) but not liquid products (R2 = 0.11). Soil management history did not consistently affect net N mineralization but may have influenced timing. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Environmental quality protection is done by processing shrimp waste into materials of high use value, including liquid fertilizer. The value of N/P ratio in shrimp culture waste fertilizer is still relatively low so it needs to add urea as a source of nitrogen to increase the N/P ratio in fertilizer. The purpose of this research was to determine the optimal N/P ratio in shrimp culture waste fertilizer to the growth of Chlorella vulgaris. The research method used in this research was an experimental method, A completely randomized design with 5 treatments and 4 replications. The treatments used are giving different N/P ratios from shrimp culture waste fertilizer enriched by urea, with N/P ratio 10:1, 15:1 and 20:1, whereas Walne fertilizer with N/P ratio 17:1 and shrimp culture waste fertilizer with N/P ratio 5,5:1 as a control. Data analyze was processed use ANAVA and followed by DMRT. The results of the research showed that the using of different N/P ratios in shrimp culture waste fertilizer enriched by urea gave a significantly different effect on the population and growth rate with the highest population average of 1030x104 cell/ml and an average growth rate of 203x104 cell/ml/day during the exponential phase. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Based on sufficient pollutants in pretreated swine wastewater (PSW), this study aimed to explore feasibility of growing water spinach (WS) in a hydroponic system using PSW as a liquid fertilizers in a hydroponic system. The tolerance values of WS to Cu(Ⅱ), Zn(Ⅱ), total phosphorus (TP), and ammonium-N (NH4 +-N) in culture solution were found to be 0.5, 2.0, 150, and 300 mg·L−1, respectively, in the hydroponic systems. The fresh stem-leaf production of WS in undiluted PSW increased by 38.9% compared to the control group (Formula B of leafy vegetable solution culture in South China Agricultural University), and the concentration of nutrients (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, β-carotene, and sugar) of WS was also higher than the control group. The concentration of Pb(Ⅱ), Hg(Ⅱ), As(Ⅴ), and Cr(Ⅱ) in WS was all below the safety standard content for agriculture production in China. After 20 d hydroponic culture, the NH4 +-N, TP, Cu(Ⅱ), and Zn(Ⅱ) concentration in PSW significantly decreased to 19.77 (&lt;80), 3.32 (&lt;8.0), 0.15(&lt;2.0), and 0.54 (&lt;5.0) mg·L−1, corresponding to removal rate of 87.91%, 92.38%, 64.29%, and 49.53%, respectively, which met the national discharge standard of livestock wastewater in China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urine has the potential to provide many valuable resources through different treatment and resource recovery methods. The aim of this work was to evaluate and summarise existing technologies for the recovery of nutrients from human urine. We focused specifically on pH as this parameter was deemed the most important when deciding on what technology to choose and what resources could be recovered from human urine. We distinguished between treatment processes for fresh, hydrolyzed and stabilized urine. A literature review was conducted to assess current innovations pertaining to urine treatment technologies such as precipitation, volume reduction, adsorption, stripping for nitrogen and phosphorus recovery. It was deduced that the most promising treatment sequence for maximum resource recovery incorporated a combination of alkaline stabilization and volume reduction. Calcium hydroxide and reverse osmosis were the chosen technologies for this. If this sequence is used, almost all urine constituents can be recovered. Moreover, a liquid fertilizer with a 3.3 - 0 - 0.8 NPK rating, and 11 g of calcium phosphate, per litre of urine treated, can theoretically be produced. Future work should focus on detailed economic and life-cycle assessment of the urine treatment sequence for maximum resource recovery. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The food industry generates enormous quantity of food waste (FW) either directly or indirectly including the processing sector, which turned into biofuels for waste remediation. Six types of food processing wastes (FPW) such as oil, fruit and vegetable, dairy, brewery, livestock and finally agriculture based materials that get treated via dark fermentation/anaerobic digestion has been discussed. Production of both hydrogen and methane is daunting for oil, fruit and vegetable processing wastes because of the presence of polyphenols and essential oils. Moreover, acidic pH and high protein are the reasons for increased concentration of ammonia and accumulation of volatile fatty acids in FPW, especially in dairy, brewery, and livestock waste streams. Moreover, the review brought to forefront the enhancing methods, (pretreatment and co-digestion) operational, and environmental parameters that can influence the production of biohythane. Finally, the nature of feedstock's role in achieving successful circular bio economy is also highlighted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The blackwater stream of domestic wastewater contains energy and the majority of nutrients that can contribute to a circular economy. Hygienically safe and odor-free nutrient solution produced from anaerobically treated source-separated blackwater through an integrated post-treatment unit can be used as a source of liquid fertilizer. However, the high water content in the liquid fertilizer represents a storage or transportation challenge when utilized on agricultural areas, which are often situated far from the urban areas. Integration of microalgae into treated source-separated blackwater (BW) has been shown to effectively assimilate and recover phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in the form of green biomass to be used as slow release biofertilizer and hence close the nutrient loop. With this objective, a lab-scale flat panel photobioreactor was used to cultivate Chlorella sorokiniana strain NIVA CHL 176 in a chemostat mode of operation. The growth of C. sorokiniana on treated source-separated blackwater as a substrate was monitored by measuring dry biomass concentration at a dilution rate of 1.38 d-1, temperature of 37 °C and pH of 7. The results indicate that the N and P recovery rates of C. sorokiniana were 99 mg N L-1d-1 and 8 mg P L-1d-1 for 10% treated BW and reached 213 mg N L-1d-1 and 35 mg P L-11d-1, respectively when using 20% treated BW as a substrate. The corresponding biomass yield on light, N and P on the 20% treated BW substrate were 0.37 g (mol photon)-1, 9.1 g g-1 and 54.1 g g-1, respectively, and up to 99% of N and P were removed from the blackwater. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The adoption of precision farming techniques (PFTs) has been widely studied targeting specific PFT or farming systems along with the potential benefits of these PFTs in terms of yield or input use. However, few studies have examined how PFTs are adopted and used at the farm level. In this study a preliminary investigation was made of on-farm PFT uses in the Oise region (northern France). Three main PFTs were identified in the area: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) guidance, section control, and variable rate (VR) application. For each farm, the use of every PFT was defined by the technical characteristics of the equipment, the field operation(s) concerned, the targeted crop(s), the aim of the use, the PFT adoption drivers, and the perceived impacts by the farmers. These different variables were combined into a typology of PFT uses. The results show that most of the farms combined GNSS guidance for all technical operations and section control, whereas VR application was less common. Section control was largely used by farmers for liquid fertilizers and phytochemical spraying. The typology shows three to five types of use for each PFT, which differ in terms of technique adoption drivers, e.g. reducing on-farm work or adaptation to field morphology. According to literature, economic impacts were found to be the most frequent, however farmers seemed unable to quantify them. Social impacts such as reduced work time and fatigue were also frequent and are becoming the main motivation for using PFT on farms studied. Further research is needed to assess the use trajectories of PFT along with the motivations of each PFT use. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The recovery of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from wastewater is of great importance in addressing the global nutrient crisis. The limitations of existing methods require the development of effective technology. Here, two different hydrogel adsorbents were fabricated with good separation ability for metal cation (M+) and metal anion (M−) but showed little removal of nutrients. Based on the materials, a novel three-stage operation system combining adsorption and capacitive deionization (CDI) technology was presented for nutrient recovery and wastewater treatment. In the first two stages, mixed metals in wastewater were successfully separated (Cu2+: 144.6 mg/g; Cr2O72−: 167.0 mg/g), and nutrients were retained (N and P &lt; 1 mg/g). In the third stage, the residual trace metal ions in the solution were removed (2.0 mg/L to N/A), and the nutrients were enriched through electroadsorption and desorption processes by CDI. Plants using recovered liquid fertilizers revealed similar values for height, root length, and chlorophyll compared with those obtained using actual fertilizers. The results indicated that this novel three-stage operation system (3S A–C system) combining adsorption and CDI is efficient in recovering liquid fertilizers from wastewater and is a promising technology for simultaneously addressing nutrient crises and environmental pollution. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the problems in providing quality clove seedlings is slow growth of clove seedlings and the unavailability of technology that can accelerate seedling growth for planting. Based on this, research has been carried out which aims to obtain the concentration and frequency of providing appropriate seaweed organic fertilizer to accelerate seedling growth. The experiment was arranged in a two-factor factorial design, four replications. The first factor were 7 concentrations of Seaweed Liquid Fertilizer (SLF): 0, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250, and 1500 ppm, and the second factor were frequency of application of 2 and 3 times every 4 weeks. The parameters observed were seedling growth (seedling height, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, stem diameter, root length and root volume), chlorophyll content, wet and dry biomass weight (leaves, stems, and roots). The results showed that seaweed from Euchema cottonii can improve the growth of clove seedlings. The E. cottonii seaweed in 1250 ppm concentration and two times every 4 weeks can improve the growth of clove seedlings. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This article presents the use of modern multicomponent liquid fertilizers in the white mustard agrocoenosis under the conditions of the Nonchernozem zone of the Russian Federation. A brief review of statistical parameters of oilseed cultivation in Russia is proposed. Under the conditions of field experiments, the features of growth and development of white mustard under the influence of multicomponent liquid fertilizers are investigated and presented. Oilseed production in the region has recently increased significantly. Such promising oilseeds as white mustard, soybean, oilseed flax, rape and others have become common. In 2018, the area under oilseeds in Ryazan region was 121.1 thousand hectares (+ 25.7 thousand hectares compared to 2017). Oilseeds processing is also gradually developing. The prospects for the use of mustard in the region are analyzed and pointed out. Currently, the production of mustard grain in Ryazan region has decreased from 18.6 to 13.1 thousand hectares, which indicates an underestimation of this crop importance. On the basis of investigations, the necessity of using foliar dressings with multicomponent liquid fertilizers in two phases of vegetation was revealed. A positive impact on the growth and development of white mustard plants in the budding phase and obtaining the greatest yield of white mustard seeds have been noted. The maximum number of seeds was obtained with variety Lucius - 13.9 centners per hectare and with Azotovit + Phosphatovit + RauAktiv it was 16.5 centners/hectare. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Leptospermum scoparium ‘Kea’, ‘Kiwi’ and ‘Ruru’ were evaluated for production as potted plants. Following environmental effects were investigated; (a) Temperatures regimes for 40 days each for two periods; (b) Photoperiods for 25 and 50 days; (c) Combined effects of temperature and duration; (d) Combined effects of temperature and irradiance and (e) Combined effects of day length, irradiance and fertilisers treatments. Floral initiation was completed following 25 days of a 9–12 h short-day (SD) photoperiod at 15/13°C (day/night). Floral development was accelerated at 20/18°C during the first period, and at 25/23°C during the second period. Flower buds were initiated at 14–15/11–14°C and SD. Although the irradiance and nutrition effects were less prominent than temperature and photoperiod, 25/22°C, high irradiance discharge (HID), and 100 ppm of nitrogen from a liquid fertiliser (LF) with 0.5 g of slow-release fertiliser (SRF) are suggested optimum for flowering. The following conditions are recommended for production of compact plants with maximum number of flowers year round starting from small propagules of three L. scoparium hybrids: 9–12 h SD under 15/13°C (day/night) for 25 days, at 20/17°C for 30 days, under 42 Wm-2 HID, and fertilisation of 100 ppm N in LF with 0.5 g of SRF. © 2020, © 2020 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

AB  - In recent years, subsoiling has been proposed as an alternative means of applying fertilizer into infertile subsoils. It was believed that root growth in the subsoiled channels would be stimulated in this way, and yields would be further increased as a result of the deep-placed fertilizer and better growing conditions. Filed test results from different cultivation areas increasingly have showed that subsoil fertilization resulted in increased crop yields when compared with subsoiling alone. However, two of the disadvantages associated with sub-soil liquid fertilizer application system is the severe soil adhesion phenomenon and high draft requirement, which seriously deteriorate operating quality and restrict its field application. To optimize sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device, mitigate the problems mentioned above and then extend sub-soil liquid fertilizer application, the technical approach of bionic engineering was adopted. From the perspective of natural environment, the interactions of living organisms with natural surroundings have led to the evolution of biological systems and environmental adaptabilities. Earthworms have long been acknowledged to largely contribute to the aggregate stability of soils varying in texture, carbonate, and concentration of organic matter by burrowing, foraging, and casting on the soil surface and within the soil. Earthworms can readily move in moist or adhesive soil with soil particles seldom adhering to bodies. From the perspective of bionic engineering, the excellent properties of earthworm could be used to inspire the design and optimization of sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device. One of the mechanisms of reducing soil adhesion for earthworms was that earthworms possess special geometrical structure on their heads and epidermis. The profile curves of earthworm head and body surface were extracted and fitted. Geometric structure surface of sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device was designed based on the contour curve equations, and the structural parameters were determined. In order to explore the influence of working parameters on working resistance and soil adhesion during the operation of sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device, and to optimize its operating parameters. Eventually, in the hope of ensuring and improving the working quality of the sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device. In this study, the Box-Behnken experimental optimum design methods were used. The working parameters of tillage depth, flow rate and speed were chosen as independent variable, to evaluate the effects on response values of drag-reducing and anti-soil adhesion. By building an agricultural soil tank test platform system, the field operating environment were simulated. Then, optimization tests of working parameters of the sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device were conducted. After that, the multivariate quadratic polynomial regression equations were built. According to the relationship between the independent variable and the response value, the working parameters of the sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device were optimized. The results showed that the regression equation model based on soil adhesion and working resistance was adequate. It was found that the working parameters of tillage depth, flow rate and speed influenced drag resistance and soil adhesion significantly. Tillage depth and speed presented interaction effects, which influenced drag resistance and soil adhesion with high significance. The significant influences of the experimental factors for drag resistance and soil adhesion were as follows: the tillage depth, speed and flow rate. The working parameters were optimized as follows: the tillage depth was 11 cm, speed was 1.0 m/s, flow rate was 350 g/s. Under the above conditions, the mean value of the drag resistance of the selected bionic prototype was 260.01 N, the mean weight of soil adhesion was 8.73 g. This study can provide technical references for the mechanization of sub-soil fertilizing engineering. © 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Degradation of Rhodamine B in aqueous solution was carried out with different microplasma medium generated from air, oxygen, nitrogen and argon gases at atmospheric pressure. Rhodamine B (RhB) aqueous solution was prepared (10 ppm) and treated in microplasma reactor at different treatment time and applied potential. The RhB degradation was mainly due to the hydroxyl radical formation, during the plasma treatment, which was identified by terephthalic acid probe method. The result shows that the oxygen microplasma produced more hydroxyl radicals than air, nitrogen and argon. The degradation percentage of RhB solution with respect to different plasma gases were estimated by using UV–Vis absorption spectra which reveals that the oxygen microplasma is most competent for complete degradation within petite time followed by air, nitrogen and argon. Post discharge phenomenon was observed in air and nitrogen microplasma treated solution, which could reduce the treatment time to accomplish complete dye degradation. The sample treated with air and nitrogen microplasma for 3 min resulted in the degradation percentage of 62.3% and 60.4%, respectively, and the complete degradation was obtained after 7 and 10 h of post discharge, respectively. Further an attempt was made to verify the reusability of air microplasma treated solution as a liquid fertilizer in cultivation purpose using Mung bean (Vignaradiata). The obtained results were encouraging as the treated water enhanced the seed germination and plant growth notably. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Increasing the efficiency of phosphorus (P) fertilizers is very important for using natural sources as well as minimizing possible environmental risks. Therefore, the effects of P, applied as monoammonium phosphate (MAP) in different forms (liquid and granule) and soil amendment containing humic-fulvic acids (HA + FA), on the growth and P uptake of model plant bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Adana-99) and vertical movement of P in a calcareous soil were investigated. The application of P in a liquid form enhanced both P uptake and shoot growth in comparison to its granule form. However, HA + FA application had no effect on either P uptake or plant growth. Although the HA + FA did not affect biomass yield, it had a strengthening effect on vertical movement, even for P applied as a granule. The application of P in liquid form not only increased P movement in the soil but also enhanced the P nutritional status of wheat. In conclusion, the results, in a supportive manner to formerly obtained limited results, showed that the application of P containing liquid fertilizers, in comparison to granular ones as well as HA + FA addition might increase the efficiency of P fertilizers; and thus enhance yield and minimize the environmental concerns, as well. © 2020, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - In this study, one-year old grapefruit trees grafted onto sour Orange (SO) and C22 rootstocks were exposed to NaCl-induced salinity (approx. 6 dS m-1) in pot culture for two months under greenhouse conditions. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with eight replicates. The trees were irrigated with saline solution containing 0.1% liquid fertilizer “Miracle-Gro Liqua Feed 9-4-9” (N-P2O5-K2O) enriched with micronutrients. The experimental treatments consisted of three levels (4 mM, 8 mM, 12 mM) of foliar applied proline along with control application. Distilled water served as the control. During the experiment the seedlings were sprayed totally five times with ten days intervals. At the end of the treatment physiologically mature leaves, free of damage or defects, were sampled. Dried and ground leaf samples were used for chemical (Na and Cl) and biochemical (DPPH scavenging activity, reducing power, total phenolic content, proline) analysis. Spesific leaf area, leaf water relations and leaf gas exchange of the plants were also determined. Foliar PRO application decreased Na and Cl concentrations of the leaves, and improved spesific leaf area in the final dose. Water leaf relations, photosynthetic activity and biochemical parameters were affected positively even though some differences were determined between the cultivars. © 2020 Federation of Eurasian Soil Science Societies.

AB  - Smart fertigation is a topic of great interest in the effort to optimize different activities involved in local and extensive agriculture for assisting crops, optimizing production by using wireless technologies, data-processing electronic boards and sensors network. With the advent of Agriculture 4.0, similar to Industry 4.0, Information Communication Technology (ICT), associated with mechatronics, is giving an added value to this technique allowing optimization of water, fertilizers, control of water flow in pipes and period of irrigation. This paper intends to illustrate findings related to an innovative low cost system for assisting crops and achieving an accurate farming by investigating on the design, construction, testing and control of dosing system for liquid and granular fertilizers. Four different dosage systems have been designed, realized and tested with different granular and liquid fertilizers; the analysis of an extensive experimental campaign allows to define the characteristic and the mathematical expressions for each analyzed fertilizer and for each dosage system. The accurate modeling allows to control with extreme precision the realized dosing systems after estimating the quantity of fertilizer which the crop needs by means of the smart fertigation system. The obtained results permit the optimization of the fertilizer dosage in terms of quantity, which at the same time translates into lower production costs, greater environmental sustainability and optimization of production in terms of quantity and quality. © 2020, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.

AB  - Compost and its liquid product can be used as an organic fertiliser. Bulking agent, microbial inoculants or compost maker can be added to improve the composting process. Compost maker is an organic substance that speeds up the composting process. It contains microorganisms that can speed up the degradation process and reduce the odour emitted during composting. Limited studies have reported the effect of compost maker on composting and its end quality. The aim of the study is to characterise the nutrient characteristics of the food waste compost treated with compost maker. The correlation between the nutrients in compost and its bio-liquid was investigated. A two-stage composting system, i.e. facultative and aerobic system, will be used. The raw materials used for composting included the post-consumed food waste, shredded palm leaves as the bulking agent and matured compost as the compost maker. Two formulations were conducted: (i) food waste composted with the shredded palm leaves and compost maker using the ratio of 2:1:1 and (ii) food waste composted with the shredded palm leaves (1:1) without the presence of compost maker as the control. The results showed that the first formulation reported the higher contents in nitrogen and potassium as compared to the control. The macronutrients of the solid compost are positively correlated with the respective bio-liquid fertiliser. The use of compost maker is recommended as a supplement to improve the quality of both the solid and liquid compost product. Copyright © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - Purpose of Review: Membrane techniques have been employed to concentrate livestock manure effluent from anaerobic digestion to produce highly concentrated liquid organic fertilizer. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding on the opportunities and challenges of membrane processes in the concentration of digested effluent for their further implementation. Recent Findings: Anaerobic digestion has been deployed to convert livestock manure into biogas (energy) and digestate with high potential as biofertilizer. Digestate can be separated into a solid and liquid fraction to reduce required capacity for onsite storage. The liquid fraction, known as digested effluent, remains a vexing challenge to digestate management due to the contradiction between its continuous production and seasonal application to farmlands, particularly in developing countries. Recent investigation has demonstrated the promise of membrane techniques for the concentration of digested effluent to recover recycling water and produce nutrient-rich liquid fertilizer. These techniques mainly include hydraulically driven membrane processes (from microfiltration to reverse osmosis), forward osmosis, membrane distillation, and electrodialysis. In most cases, these membrane techniques are hybridized to enhance the concentration efficiency. Nevertheless, the practical application of these membrane processes is hindered by several technical challenges, which mainly include membrane fouling, contaminant enrichment, ammonia volatilization, and high economic input. Summary: In this paper, we critically reviewed the performance of different membrane processes in the concentration of digested livestock manure effluent. Key technical challenges and their potential countermeasures were elucidated. Furthermore, future perspectives were provided to shed light on further development of membrane concentration techniques in the field. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Field experiments with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were carried out at the Experimental Station of Vytautas Magnus University, Agriculture Academy in Lithuania. Spring wheat was dressed with N90 P90 K116 at sowing and N60 was applied at the stem elongation stage. Liquid amide (NH2) nitrogen fertilizer with magnesium and sulphur was applied either at the tillering stage or at the stem elongation stage. The experiment treatments (nutrient doses in kg ha-1): 1) control; 2) 0.3 Mg + 0.4 S + 1.1 N (F1); 3) 0.6 Mg + 0.8 S + 2.2 N (F2); 4) 0.9 Mg + 1.2 S + 3.3 N (F3); 5) 1.2 Mg + 1.6 S + 4.4 N (F4); 6) 3.0 Mg + 4 S + 11.0 N (F5). Liquid fertilizer applied at the spring wheat’s tillering stage in the soil with a moderate status of magnesium and sulphur did not significantly change the content of chlorophyll a in wheat leaves within 10 days after application. A significant effect of this fertilizer on the chlorophyll a content was identified when spring wheat at the stem elongation stage had been treated with F2-F5 (2014) and F1-F5 (2015) fertilizer doses. Significant effect on the carotenoid content was recorded in the plots applied F3 (2014) and F2-F4 (2015) doses. A significant increase in the nitrogen content in wheat plants was observed in the treatments fertilized with F1-F5 doses at the tillering stage and those applied F3-F5 fertilizer doses at the stem elongation stage. The relationship between the nitrogen content in wheat plants and fertilizer doses was strong and significant. Significant grain yield increases were obtained in the treatments fertilized with F3-F5 doses ates at tillering and those fertilized with F2 and F3 doses at the stem elongation stage. Statis-tically significant correlations between fertilizer doses and grain yield were,,determined for both growth stages at which the fertilizer had been applied, i.e. at tillering and at stem elongation. Fertilizers tended to increase the grain protein content; however, a significant increase in the grain protein content was observed only in the treatment fertilized with F3 dose at stem elongation. © 2020, Polish Society Magnesium Research.

AB  - One type of vegetable that is popular among the Indonesian is mustard greens (Brassica junceaL.), which is also known as Caisim because it is often processed into various dishes and contains various ingredients and vitamins which are good for health. The last few years Caisim production has decreased, one of the causes is the constraints in the cultivation process, especially in the use of fertilizers due to the relatively long-term use of inorganic fertilizers. To improve the cultivation of Caisim without looking at the soil conditions, we can use a hydroponic system. However, hydroponics need more cost because the AB MIX nutrition is still relatively expensive, so it needs an alternative nutrient as a substitute for AB MIX which has the same ability. AB Mix is a mixture of fertilizer A and fertilizer B. Fertilizer A contains potassium while fertilizer B contains sulfate and phosphate. An alternative nutrient as a substitute for AB MIX which has the same ability, such as liquid fertilizer based on local microorganisms (LMO) which has properties that are easily absorbed by plants so that the use of organic nutrients can be used as a source of substitute nutrition, which is more economically affordable and has a very good influence on Caisim and is expected to increase production in Caisim cultivation. This study used a Completely Randomized Design with a single factor experimental design consisting of 4 treatments, namely a combination of AB MIX solution and various kinds of LMO-based organic nutrients as follows: A = LMO A 5 ml + AB MIX 5 mL/L of water; B = LMO B 5 mL + AB MIX 5 mL/L water; C = LMO A 5 mL + MOL B 5 mL/Liter water; D = AB MIX 10 mL/L water. The variables observed were plant height, number of leaves, and biomass of Caisim. The results showed that the variation of AB MIX nutrition and liquid organic fertilizer based on LMO effectively increased the growth of Caisim plants. The highest average plant height was given by Caisim with AB MIX nutrition, which is 69.2 cm. The highest average number of leaves was obtained by Caisim which was grown with a combination of LMO A and LMO B nutrients, which was 27.8. The largest average wet weight was given by Caisim with AB MIX nutrition, which is 32.3 g. According to the three parameters, the use of ab mix nutrients is 10 mL/L water and a combination of LMO A 5 mL + LMO B 5 mL/L water is the most effective combination of nutrients for hydroponic Caisim growth. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Bukit Kijang Village is one of the villages that is classified as young in the Namang Bangka Tengah District. one of the flagship programs of the Bukit K.ijang village, which is farm-based agriculture on ex-mining land. To achieve the success of the program, it is necessary to make appropriate solutions for waste management to support the progress in agriculture. Village farms have 9 adult cows and 1 turtle calf so that cow dung produced is quite a lot. To overcome the problem of cow waste and household waste, one step is by making biogas from cow dung which can also produce solid and liquid fertilizer and utilization household organic waste in making biofertilizers. Mentoring activities were attended by Ladies of Family Welfare Empowerment, villagers and village youth groups. Both products produced are less than perfect due to equipment leakage and lack of shelf life so that the biogas and biological fertilizers that are formed are not perfect. So can't to test the products. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The studies were carried out to determine the compliance of traction-speed performance of the tractor as part of the machine-tractor unit with aggregation requirements, taking into account the random nature of changes in external factors. The work was carried out using the example of the assembly Fendt 936 Vario + AVA-12.6 "Agropitatel" in Leninsk-Kuznetsk district of Kemerovo region in 2017. Using the control dynamometer method, the probabilistic characteristics of the traction resistance of the machine, its dependence on the speed of movement in the operations of the main tillage and intra-soil liquid fertilizer application were determined. The studies were carried out on medium humus on stubble background with depth of soil treatment and fertilizing of 21 cm and the average length of run 1100 m. The tractor Fendt 936 Vario does not ensure compliance with the requirements for operating speed and slipping of propellers when working within the range of average specific drag. Power equipment with the estimated parameters will improve the traction coefficient of performance for 4.7..13.6% in comparison with the tractor Fendt 936 Vario, which will increase the average working traction on the hook, which is implemented without violation of the established requirements. The result will be an increase in the average operating speeds of the unit and an increase of its net hourly productivity. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Red pepper production in 2016-2017 was increased. Although production has increased, demand for pepper will continue to increase, and efforts to increase soil fertility still need to be sought. To maintain and increase soil productivity, a combination of inorganic fertilizers with appropriate organic fertilizers is needed. One of the organic fertilizers is biofertilizers. This research aimed at finding out the formulation and dosage of biological fertilizers consortium of cellulolytic bacteria based on organic liquid waste that was appropriate for the growth and yield of red pepper plants. This research method used a Completely Randomized Design with 12 treatments, namely (5, 10, 15) ml of biological fertilizer of waste water washing rice, (5, 10, 15) ml of biological fertilizer of coconut water waste, (5, 10, 15) ml of biological fertilizer of tofu water waste, (5, 10, 15) ml of palm oil liquid fertilizer. The results showed that all biological fertilizer application based on organic liquid waste cellulolytic was able to give varied results on each parameter observed so that all wastes could be applied to pepper plants. Tofu wastewater biofertilizer with a dose of 10 ml give a good response to the production of pepper plants compared to other treatments. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Bioremediation is one technique to reduce environmental pollution and renew soil with the help of microorganisms and plants. The process carried out includes detoxification of toxic chemicals by cleaning the environment naturally and economically. This study aims to identify waste recycling, modification of ecology-based farming systems, and test traditional plants as a source of bioremediation. Then, bacteria and bioremediation results will be used as liquid fertilizer. Liquid fertilizers are processed through bioremediation techniques, then reused as nutrients for organic cosmetics plants. The research method is carried out qualitatively and its application is in a polluted environment. The research findings state that there is a positive impact on reducing environmental pollution, especially in reducing the volume of waste and the smell of garbage. Meanwhile, the success of bioremediation in liquid fertilizer depends on the Hydrogen (H2) cycle. In addition to H2, there are carbon (C), sulfur (S), and nitrogen (N) during the bioremediation process which encourages the bioremediation of liquid organic fertilizer to be able to fertilize the plant source of organic cosmetics. Thus, cosmetics can be said to be organic as a whole. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Anaerobic co-digestion of sewage sludge with organic wastes has recently gained attention in small facilities. For small facilities, high solids sludge is suitable for transportation to a centralized co-digester, and direct utilization of the digested sludge as liquid fertilizer is recommended. Effects of high solid and hyperthermophilic pretreatment (80 °C, 24 hr) on anaerobic digestion at low temperatures and utilization as fertilizer are investigated by anaerobic/aerobic digestion and paddy soil incubation experiments. The volatile solids (VS)/total solids (TS) ratio decreases to 0.57(-), and the VS removal rate is approximately 0.7 (-) after long-term aerobic digestion. This is possibly the limitation of biodegradation, even with pretreatment, within engineering time. Substrate TS of 16% (not diluted), 10% and 5% are compared. The effect of substrate TS on biogas production performance (0.2-0.3 NL/gVS-added) is not statistically observed. Laboratory-scale paddy soil incubation experiments are performed fed with anaerobically digested pretreated or not pretreated dewatered sludge as liquid fertilizer. Pretreatment promotes nitrogen mineralization before use as fertilizer, which is helpful to prevent an outflow of surplus ammonia to the environment. The effect of soil type on microbial communities is more significant than that of anaerobically digested sludge conditions. © IWA Publishing 2019 Water Science & Technology.

AB  - The plant always associates with microbes for its life, includes the endophytes. Aim of this study is to examine the effect of endophytic fungi on Kopsia (Kopsia arborea) seed germination and seedling growth. Here, we used endophytic fungus from forest pathology laboratory, namely Phomopsis sp1, Phomopsis sp2, and Helminthosporium sp. All endophytic fungi were combined with liquid fertilizer to assess Kopsia seedling growth. The results showed that the Kopsia seed germinations, which treated with endophytic fungi have a higher value than the control. The endophytic fungi Phomopsis sp1 and Helminthosporium sp could increase the number of leaves without adding liquid fertilizer, while the Phomopsis sp2 needed liquid fertilizer for it. The NPA and the IMB values of the Kopsia seedlings are 0.71-1.71, and 0.18-0.33 strongly indicates the readiness of Kopsia seedlings to plant in the field, respectively. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This research aims to evaluate the quality of goat feces liquid biofertilizer with chicken excreta addition by aerobic and anaerobic fermentation. The data obtained from the research were statistically analyzed with Completely Randomized Design (CRD) Factorial Pattern with two factors. The first factor was addition level of the chicken excreta (0, 10, 20, and 30%) and the other factor was fermentation treatment (aerobic and anaerobic) condition with 3 replications for each treatment. Fermentation was conducted for 14 days. The observed parameters consisted of the chemical parameter (organic-C, N, P, and K) and the physical parameter (pH, temperature, and the odor). The addition of various level of chicken excreta and fermentation treatments in the process of producing goat feces liquid biofertilizer indicate significantly effect to increase the organic-C, total-N, NH4, P, K, compare with 5 and 10% liquid fertilizer treatment. The best quality of liquid biofertilizer produced by combining aerobic fermentation and the addition of 30% chicken excreta. Generally, chicken excreta able to increase the nitrogen and mineral content, and putting together with aerobic fermentation system of chicken excreta maximum to 30% can avoid overproduction of unpleasant odor. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to observe the growth rate of Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria as biological agents to stimulate plant growth and inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. The method used were aimed to extract the micro, macro and growth stimulating substances contained in the thallus of Sargassum seaweed which had been fermented for 5 days using 0.3% KOH solution and then heated at 70C for 2 hours. The filtrate obtained was formulated by adding silage and molasses which were then sterilized at 121C for 15 minutes. The P. fluorescence bacteria were inoculated into the formulation solution and observed for 20 days with a span of 5 days against pH values, thickness, total nitrogen, Corganic, electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved of solid (TDS) and growth rate of P. flourescens. The results showed that the pH value did not show significant differences but the viscosity value, total nitrogen, Corganic, EC, TDS, and TPC were significantly different. The best results were found on the 10th day of inoculation of P. fluorescence in a non-sterile formulation solution with a pH value of 3.76, thickness of 2.95 cPs, total N-0.62%, Corganic 0.1%, EC 9,814 μS / cm, TDS 4,602 ppm and Total Plate Count of 10.6 log CFU/ml. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we take citrus orchard as target, evaluate the safety of agricultural biogas slurry by comparing the properties of unfermented manure and biogas slurry from 27 farms in Chongqing. The results indicate that the amount of harmful heavy metal element in biogas slurry completely meets the requirements in China agricultural standards "Biogas Fertilizer" (NY/T 2596) and "Organic Fertilizer" (NY 525), indicating the biogas slurry is safe to use as fertilizer. These results provide data support in formulating a stricter standard about the limitations of harmful heavy metal containment ratio in biogas slurry. Biogas slurry can replace chemical fertilizer partly, and can be popularized as a good new type of liquid fertilizer. A certain amount of biogas slurry irrigation can basically meet the supply of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrition, and zero use of chemical fertilizer (nitrogen and phosphorus) come true. However, the content of biogas slurry varies greatly, the measurement of fertilizer efficiency is complex, and it cannot meet the balanced supply of all mineral nutrients, which will lead to the imbalance of nutrient abundance and deficiency. The nutritional diagnosis should be used to monitor the nutritional level of trees, guide the control of abundance and deficiency, enhance the efficiency of citrus orchards to absorb the effective elements of biogas slurry, and improve the yield and quality of citrus. Through monitoring the runoff quality of the orchard returned with biogas slurry, it is found that the runoff quality of the orchard is inferior V. Total phosphorus and granular phosphorus are the main contaminating sources of the outflow runoff in orchard. This indicates that the problems of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution need to be prevented and controlled in the process of returning the biogas slurry to the orchard. It is necessary to establish the landscape system of fruit grass in the orchard and the interception system of flood interception ditches, sediment pockets and buffer ponds in order to sand, retention and reduction of particulate phosphorus. Based on this, a bunch of agricultural biogas slurry returning technology model suitable for modern ecological citrus orchard planting was summarized. The technical standards for biogas slurry harmlessly returning to citrus orchard and technical specification for formula fertilization of citrus nutrition diagnosis, were formed. It has been applied on a large scale in Chongqing three gorges reservoir area and national modern eco-agricultural demonstration base, and has achieved remarkable socio-economic and ecological environmental benefits. The results of this study provide data and technical support for the formulation of two new national standards of "Agricultural Biogas Slurry" and "Technical Specification for Harmless Treatment of Agricultural Biogas Slurry". © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used to ease agricultural activities and has been progressed with recent technology development to perform aerial spraying in the rice cultivation. In fact, UAV aerial spraying ability is not just limited to crop protection but it can be extended for crop fertilization activities. However, off-target and insufficient amount of droplet deposition density during the spraying operation has always been a major concern in research area for UAV aerial spraying. The study aimed to evaluate the optimal operating parameters such as UAV flying speeds, and spraying rate on the droplet deposition density of the targeted surface for a standard UAV spraying system available in the market. Field trials were performed by using UAV that flew at the different flying speeds (2, 4 & 6 m/s), at the constant height of 2 m above the rice canopy to spray the organic liquid fertilizer at the different spraying rate (0.75, 1.5, 2.25 & 3.00 L/min). The water-sensitive paper was used as a sampler to collect droplets and droplet deposition density was statistically analysed. The experimental results showed that the droplet uniformity and droplet deposition density was higher when the UAV flying speed was maintained at the lower speed (2 m/s) compared to the higher flying speed (4 and 6 m/s). Hence, the droplet uniformity and droplet deposition density show the highest count with better droplet pattern when spraying the organic liquid fertilizer at 3.00 L/min spray-rate compared to other sprayer rates. Results from the study could provide technical support for UAV aerial spraying within the rice cultivation field. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Liquid organic fertilizers produced from agricultural residues and industrial wastes are becoming increasingly popular. This study aimed to examine the effect of liquid organic fertilizers produced from waste molasses, distillery slop and sugarcane leaves on the growth of Green Cos Lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. longifolia). Methods: Six formulas of liquid organic fertilizers were produced with different ratios of substrates (molasses, distillery slop and sugarcane leaves). The measurements of chemical, microbiological and germination index of fertilizers were studied. Hydroponic using nutrient film technique system was used to grow vegetables with fertilizers. Results: Fertilizers showed the ranges of chemical parameters as follows: pH 4.5–7.8, EC 25–33 dS/m, total N 0.14–0.33%, total P2O5 0.002–0.017%, total K2O 0.81–11.8%, OM 0.26–3.25%, OC 0.26–3.20% and C:N ratio 6.14–17.92. Microbiological analysis indicated total microorganism of 9.99–9.05 logCFU/ml. Nitrogen fixers, phosphate and potassium solubilizing agents were found in all formulas. IAA concentration was 1.13–59.53 mg/l. The fertilizers produced after 30 days of fermentation and used at a dilution of 1:100 gave more than 100% germination index showing non-phytotoxicity characteristics. The results for the hydroponic system showed that liquid fertilizer formula 3 (distillery slop: sugarcane leaves: filtrate water 1:0.1:0.25 v:w:v) and formula 5 (distillery slop: sugarcane leaves 1:0.25:0.25 v:w:v) demonstrated the best growth performance, which was similar to plants treated with liquid chemical fertilizer. Conclusion: This study showed that organic liquid fertilizers formulas 3 and 5 had similar growth promotion properties as chemical fertilizers with Green Cos Lettuce. Moreover, our products are organic and serve as a rich nutrient source for the plant. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - The current broadcasting method for chemical fertilizer applications for rice production causes significant nitrogen losses through volatilization. To minimize this problem, a liquid-jet nozzle was developed for injection of liquid fertilizer in paddy fields. With computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the liquid-jet nozzle was modelled to examine the mass flow rates and velocities as affected by the critical design parameters of the nozzle: fertilizer inlet diameter (df) and nozzle orifice diameter (do). The model was validated with tests, and the performance of the liquid-jet nozzle was evaluated through injecting Urea Ammonium Nitrate solution into a clay loam soil. Simulation results showed that flow velocities decreased and mass flow rates increased at larger do values in a non-linear fashion. Effects of df were less pronounced and depended on the values of do. The model results agreed well with the test results with relative errors between 0.4 and 13.3%. Considering the requirements of nitrogen application rates for rice (60–180 kg ha−1) and soil cutting depths (20–50 mm), the optimal design parameters for the liquid-jet nozzle were the combinations of (df, do): (1.0, 1.0 mm) for producing the highest nitrogen application rate, and (0.6, 0.8 mm) for having the highest ability in cutting soil. The liquid-jet nozzle, a non-traditional injection method, has high potential to become a cost-effective and low soil-disturbance practice for rice production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the robust demand for food, fiber and bio energy resources, there is a rapid hire for strategies that perform utilization of finite resources, providing a real provocation to the agricultural industry, investigator and collaborators. Released funds in agriculture around past years have seen the growth of organic manures and fertilizers. The enhanced use of microbial inoculants (Bacteria, Cyanobacteria and Fungi) in crop plants has increase the mobilization of key microelements in soil such as potassium, phosphorous and nitrogen. In account of the large scale agro-industrial waste collected in a year throughout the world, it contained a major share of lignocelluloses and starch. Here, we advocate the terminology, nano encapsulation of bio-inoculants and their potential in providing macronutrients for variant soil and plant biomes. Evidence to support larger crop yield are currently disconcerted by insufficient plot study and poor knowledge on their essential metabolism, which had led to conflicting reports on their field performance. There is moreover, a scope to improve sustainable macronutrient profiling in soil plant symbiotic system. The further investigation can be performed on studies that suggest entangling activities of microbial interactions in soil. © 2019 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

AB  - Challenge in the expansion of maize and soybean planting areas is the limited agricultural labor from land processing activities, planting to post-harvest. Considering that the corn and soybean cultivation systems are still traditionally done using both human and livestock power so that the productivity and work efficiency produced is still low. This affects the area of land that can be cultivated, land productivity and the production of corn produced. To support the program to expand the planting area and increase the crop index to increase corn production, it is necessary to support the use of appropriate mechanization technology and under site-specific conditions. Therefore it is necessary to introduce agricultural machinery to support the corn cultivation system to increase productivity, work efficiency, increase yields and improve the quality of results. In this activity the implementation and development of mechanization technology for corn and soybean cultivation is appropriate and by site-specific conditions at the demonstration plot scale in the corn and soybean production centers by taking into account the technical, economic, and socio-economic conditions of the local community. Indonesian Center for Agricultural Engineering Research and Development has developed a rotary and planting machine that can do soil treatment and planting seeds at once. This machine is equipped with a solid fertilizer application. But in practice, farmers rarely use liquid fertilizer for corn/soybean cultivation. Test results of tillage and planting of corn seeds: Work depth of 12.1 cm; spacing in rows 38.5 cm; spacing in rows of 70 cm; number of seeds per fall 2.2 items; percentage of empty holes 4.1%; work width is an average of 162.88 cm; average working speed of 2.31 km/h; average work capacity of 4.08 hours/ha; fuel consumption of 20.32 lt/ha. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This article presents statistical parameters for the cultivation of oilseeds in Russia. Ryazan region is not among the regions that are traditional producers of vegetable oil, but recently oilseed production has been actively developing in the region. Gradually developing and processing oilseeds. In 2018, the area under oilseeds in Ryazan region was 121.1 thousand hectares (+ 25.7 thousand hectares by 2017). The prospects for the use of mustard in the region are noted. Currently, the production of mustard grain in Ryazan region has decreased from 18.6 to 13.1 thousand hectares, which indicates an underestimation of the significance of this crop. The study of multicomponent liquid fertilizers in the field confirmed their beneficial effect on the growth and development of white mustard. Foliar dressing according to the vegetation phases contributed to better preservation of plants, due to this, and obtaining the greatest yield of white mustard seed. The maximum number of seeds was obtained on variety Lucius - 13.9 dt/ha, with the effect of Azotovit + Phosphatovit + RauAktiv - 16.5 dt/ha. The effective action of Galleon herbicide on such weed families as Asteraceae, Labiatae, Solanaceae, some species of Polygonaceae and Chenopodiaceae was observed. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Aquaponics is an activity to cultivate plants and fish. Giving the organic liquid fertilizer as a nutrient enhancer will improve the quality of catfish and lettuce yields. However, this causes the water to become dirtier. The deteriorating water is characterized by the TDS value in aquaponic ponds exceeding 500 PPM. If the TDS value exceeds 500 PPM, water drainage will be applied. For treatment of aquaponic, experts use manual control. The system is designed to solve it. The method used in this Final Project is the study of literature to find the basic theory in aquaponics and analyze the problems. The next thing to do is designing the system, starting from the design of automatic control systems to remote monitoring systems. Afterwards, testing tools is conducted to see whether the system is able to run well. Based on the test results, the system can run well; however, a number of deviations are found, including the RTC test showing a delay time for 00.02.10 of RTC compared to the national standard time and an error of 2.4% found on a calibrated TDS sensor testing. The success rate of sending monitoring data is 100% of Antares connectivity testing. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tradidional-market waste liquid organic fertilizers can be used to fertilize setaria grass (Setaria splendida Stapf). This research was conducted to get information concerning the best dosage of liquid organic fertilizer utilization. An experimental method using Completely Randomized Design was applied in this study. The treatments were: 6 (six) doses of mixtures of the liquid organic fertilizer : water, of the ratios of 0:0, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, and 1:5, volume by volume, each of which was repeated 4 times. The land area used was 2 m x 1.5 m per plot (experimental unit). The variables measured were the dry matter (DM) concentration, DM production, crude protein (CP), crude fat (CFt), and crude fiber (CFb) contents. The data used were the results of the harvest at second defoliation. The results of the study showed that the doses of water in the fertilizer did not indicate any significant differences on all variables being studied. On the basis of the results, it is suggested that the addition of water into the fertilizer can be applied up to 5 folds the volume of the organic liquid fertilizer in the agronomy management of Setaria grass. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This research aimed to study the effect of different formulas of organic liquid fertilizer and Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) inoculation level on the growth and production of environmentally friendly grown shallot. The study was carried out at the experimental farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Hasanuddin, Makassar, from August to November 2015. Three formula of organic liquid fertilizer used was formula HNI.A (fresh cow feces + rice washing water + Annona muricata leaf extract), formula HNI.B (fresh cow feces+ rice washing water + banana fruit extract + banana peel extract), and commercial liquid Bioslurry (fermented cow urine). The inoculation of AMF applied was at the concentration of 0.50 g, 0.70 g, and 1 g per plant. The results show that the interaction between the use of liquid organic fertilizers and AMF inoculation affect some vegetative characters of shallots such as the number of leaves, the number of stems at 30 days after planting (DAP), and 55 DAP, and leaf area at 30 DAP. The highest shallot yield was in 0.7 g AM per plant, which was 3.32 tons per hectare compared to control of 1.68 tons per hectare. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A research was carried out to study the morphophysiological response of cocoa plant leaves to different application of microbes formulation in the farmer's cocoa plantations in Gantarangkeke village, Gantarangkeke district, Bantaeng Regency, South Sulawesi Province from July to December 2016. The experiment was set using Randomized Block Design with nine combinations of dosages and frequencies of the application of microbe formulation as treatments. The formula was sprayed on cocoa leaves using bio-mineral liquid fertilizer with dosages of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mL.L-1 applied once, twice and three times during the experiment. The first application was at the start of the experiment, and the second was at the age of 2 months after planting, respectively. For the three times application treatment, plants were sprayed by the formula every two months. The experiment used three replications, and each experimental unit consisted of four selected plants which were relatively uniform. Results show that the application of microbial formulations through leaves could increase some morphophysiological properties of the leaves of cocoa plants. The application of microbial formulations of 1.5 mL.L-1 of water every two months during the study showed an increase in leaf area growth, leaf water content, chlorophyll a, b and total chlorophyll content of cocoa leaves. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - It is a report of an experiment aimed to determine part of branch cutting along with the concentration of liquid organic fertilizer which is best for the growth of passion fruit seedling. The experiment took place in Lemo-Lemo Village, Sub-district of Pattapang-Tinggi Moncong, Regency of Gowa Regency, South Sulawesi. The experiment was designed in the form of a 2-factor factorial experiment in a Randomized Block Design. The first factor consisted of four levels of concentration of liquid organic fertilizer, namely: (1) without application of liquid fertilizer, (2) concentration of 5 mL L-1, (3) concentration of 10 mL L-1, and (4) concentration of 15 mL L-1. The second factor was the source of cuttings with three levels: (1) base cutting, (2) middle cutting, and (3) tip cutting. The results showed that application of liquid organic fertilizer of 10 mL of L-1 gave the best influence on several variables. They were shoot length (38.33 cm), number of leaves (9.17 leaf unit), number of branches (7.33 branch), length root (22.27 cm), and leaf area (13.81 cm2). Compared to base and tip cuttings, the middle cuttings gave the best influence on several variables. These variables were: shoot length (38.33 cm), number of leaves (9.17 leaf unit), number of branches (7.33 branches), root length (22.27 cm), and leaf area (15.67 cm2). The interaction between the concentration of 10 ml L-1 and the middle cutting gave the best effect on shoot length (38.33 cm) and root length (22.27 cm). © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Organic fertilizers are able to bind the ability of soil to absorb water, increase resistance to erosion, improve biodiversity, and increase soil fertility, but will not increase residuals on crop yields so it is safe for the environment and human health. Agricultural waste is a by-product of agriculture that is not utilized or thrown away so that it has no sale value like vegetable waste, rotten fruit, coconut fiber, agricultural waste, fisheries and household waste, which can directly cause environmental pollution, sources disease, and interfering with environmental cleanliness. Rumen cow is a slaughterhouse waste that is not utilized properly, even though the rumen still contains nutrients, microbes and undigested food that can be recycled. The objective of this study was to find out the ratio of the composition of rumen fluid and agricultural waste to the liquid organic fertilizer nutrient content. The analysis method used was 3x3 technique of rumen fluid for each control, namely PI 15% rumen fluid, PII 30% rumen fluid and PIII 45% rumen fluid. The results of the nutrient analysis of organic liquid fertilizer towards agricultural waste and rumen liquid showed that the highest nitrogen in PII is 1.85%, PIII was 1.29% and Pi was 0.68%. The highest phosphorus (P) content in PII was 2.52%, PIII was 2.47% and PI was 1.87% and the highest potassium (K) content was in PII (2.90), PIII was 2.72 and PI was 2.14. According to the results obtained, nutrient analysis of liquid organic fertilizer is in accordance with the quality standards of liquid organic fertilizer regulated in the Agriculture Regulation No. 28/Regulation of the Minister of Agriculture/OT.140/2/200 which stated that liquid organic fertilizer for its N-total content, Phosphorus and Potassium is greater of 2%. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Struvite precipitation is an effective method to remove and recover ammonia and phosphate from livestock wastewater. Struvite has properties similar to those of the traditional ammonium-phosphate fertilizer, which does not burn the roots owing to its slow-release characteristics. Struvite is an effective fertilizer as its nutrient-releasing rate is very slow. But the release rate of ammonia and phosphate in soil depends on the size of crystals. In this study, the nutrient-releasing pattern of three types of struvite crystals and liquid fertilizer was compared using soil column. X-Ray fluorescence spectrometry was conducted to investigate the potential use of struvite as a fertilizer. Various struvite crystalline fertilizers were evaluated for their fertilizer performance by cultivating potted vegetable crops. The nitrogen removal efficiency of zeolite-seeded struvite was higher than that of no seed struvite. The ammonia nitrogen removal efficiency was more than 99% irrespective of the kind of zeolite. The soil column test revealed that nutrient releasing from liquid fertilizer and zeolite-seeded struvite recovered from livestock wastewater was 11 and 63 days, respectively. Struvite recovered from livestock wastewater contained more than 20% (w/w) potassium oxide; however, the concentration of heavy metals, such as copper and zinc, was very low. Therefore, we considered that the synthesized struvite using livestock wastewater has high value as fertilizer. The recovered struvite was effective under appropriate concentrations to cultivate all the applied vegetable crops in this study. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aims at assessing the influence of mineral fertilization and biofertilizer from liquid swine manure (LSM) in productivity, levels of crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF) of Urochloa decumbens. The experiment was carried out in a red Latosol under a Urochloa decumbens pasture, in a state of degradation with loss of vigor and forage productivity. The delineation chosen for this study was randomized blocks with six treatments (control without fertilization, control with use of mineral fertilizer and four unique concentrations of liquid swine manure biofertilizer (61 m3 ha-1, 121 m3 ha-1, 181 m3 ha-1, 241 m3 ha-1)). The application of residue has been split in two times on the surface of the soil, by means of a distributor of liquid waste with a fan-shaped application. Yield and bromatological features were evaluated for two years. Fertilization with LSM can fully replace mineral fertilizing in Urochloa decumbens pasture systems, resulting in an increase, as a result, in the dry mass yield from the dosage of 121 m3 ha-1 and the reduction in fiber content in neutral and acid detergent. The increments in yield were observed in the second year, while improvement in bromatological quality was observed from the first application of LSM. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) accounts for more than 80% of the total mineral nutrients absorbed by plants and it is the most widely limiting element for crop production, particularly under water deficit conditions. For a comprehensive understanding of sunflower Helianthus annuus N uptake under deficit irrigation conditions, experimental and numerical simulation studies were conducted for full (100% ETC) and deficit (65% ETC) irrigation practices under the semi-arid conditions of the Imperial Valley, California, USA. Plants were established with overhead sprinkler irrigation before transitioning to subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). Based on pre-plant soil N testing, 39 kg ha-1 of N and 78 kg ha-1 of P were applied as a pre-plant dry fertilizer in the form of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and an additional application of 33 kg ha-1 of N from urea ammonium nitrate (UAN-32) liquid fertilizer was made during the growing season. Soil samples at 15-cm depth increments to 1.2 m (8 layers, 15 cm each) were collected prior to planting and at three additional time points from two locations each in the full and deficit irrigation treatments. We used HYDRUS/2D for the simulation in this study and the model was calibrated for the soil moisture parameters (θs and θr), the rate constant factors of nitrification (the sensitive parameter) in the liquid and solid states (μω,3, and μs,3). The HYDRUS model predicted cumulative root water uptake fluxes of 533 mm and 337 mm for the 100% ETC and 65% ETC, respectively. The simulated cumulative drainage depths were 23.7 mm and 20.4 mm for the 100% ETC and 65% ETC which represented only 4% and 5% of the applied irrigation water, respectively. The soil wetting profile after SDI irrigation was mostly around emitters for the last four SDI irrigation events, while the maximum values of soil moisture in the top 30 cm of the soil profile were 0.262 cm3 cm-3 and 0.129 cm3 cm-3 for 100% ETC and 65% ETC, respectively. The 16.5 kg ha-1 (NH2)2CO (50% of the total N) that was applied during the growing season was completely hydrolyzed to NH4 + within 7 days of application, while 4.36 mg cm-1 cumulative decay was achieved by the end of the 98-day growing season. We found that 86% of NH4 + (74.25 mg cm-1) was nitrified to NO3 - while 14% remained in the top 50 cm of the soil profile. The denitrification and free drainage of NO3 - were similar for 100% ETC and 65% ETC, and the maximum nitrate was drained during the sprinkler irrigation period. By the end of the growing season, 30.8 mg cm-1 of nitrate was denitrified to N2 and the reduction of nitrate plant uptake was 17.1% for the deficit irrigation section as compared to the fully irrigated side (19.44 mg cm-1 vs. 16.12 mg cm-1). This reduction in N uptake due to deficit irrigation on sunflower could help farmers conserve resources by reducing the amount of fertilizer required if deficit irrigation practices are implemented due to the limited availability of irrigation water. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In order to prepare sustained-release organic liquid fertilizer, alginate and amide nitrogen urea were used as materials to study the release of alginate from urea and its application in soilless cultivation. The interactions between alginate and urea in aqueous solutions were investigated based on particle size, zeta-potential, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements. We used ultrafiltration centrifuge tubes to separate the alginate, binary complex of alginate and urea, and free urea. The sustained-release action of alginate was characterized by measuring the content of free urea. XRD and FTIR results revealed that a binary complex between alginate and urea was successfully generated because of non-covalent interaction forces, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effects. The release efficiency of alginate was 54.58% with urea. These results indicate that alginate is suitable for the slow release of urea in aqueous solutions, which is advantageous for the preparation of soilless algal organic fertilizers. In soilless cultivation experiments, the urea release by alginate was slower, resulting a fresh weight, dry weight, protein content, and soluble sugar content retention after the end of the growth of 23.93, 51.16, 23.76, and 16.32%, respectively. These values were higher than those of the control (P <0.05), increasing the growth and N uptake by the crop plants. This trend increased with time, emphasizing the significant role of alginate in urea retention in soilless cultures. The results demonstrated the potential for soilless culture agriculture and the effectiveness of slow-release alginate. © 2019

AB  - The conservation tillage and liquid fertilization can enhance the productivity of farmland. However, soil adhesion occurs on the surfaces of soil-tillage implements during liquid fertilizer applications. Soil adhesion phenomenon can increase energy consumption and decreases fertilizer application quality. The working procedure of liquid fertilizer application by sub-soil liquid fertilizer involves soil compression and shearing, hence, the shape and surface features of the sub-soil liquid fertilizer could significantly affect the performance of soil penetrating, in turn, affect the quality of liquid fertilizer application. Improving the shape design of soil engaging tool is one of the effective methods for reducing operating resistance and increasing working quality. Therefore, a sub-soil liquid fertilizer with novel geometries and surface features should be investigated, and attempts should be made to improve operating efficiency of liquid fertilizer application. Biologically inspired engineering is the application of biological methods found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems. When pressed with an engineering problem in agriculture, engineers could find wisdom and inspirations from the natural world. Through learning from the natural world, it is found that the interactions of living organisms with natural surroundings have led to the evolution of biological systems and environmental adaptabilities. Among the living organisms, earthworms have long been acknowledged to largely contribute to the aggregate stability of soils varying in texture, carbonate, and concentration of organic matter by burrowing, foraging, and casting on the soil surface and within the soil. Besides, earthworms can comfortably move in moist or adhesive soil, it's worth noting that soil particles seldom sticking to bodies. One of the soil fertilization mechanisms for earthworms is that the earthworm swallowed soil and excreted particle casts while burrowing in soil. In this process, the earthworm mucus plays critical roles in adhesion reducing, soil fertilizing and so on. Inspired by this special behavior of earth worm, bionic engineering approach was used and novel method for improving soil fertility were provided in this study. The profile curves of earthworm head and body surface were extracted and fitted using image processing technology. Geometric structure surface of sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection device was designed based on the contour curve equations. The sub-soil liquid injection fertilizer devices (3 injection holes and 6 injection holes) which matched with the bionic subsoiler, were designed. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) was chosen as the material for manufacture this device. The significant influence of factors for investigation was the liquid injection, the number of holes, the materials and the surface structure for drag resistance, and the surface structure, the number of holes, the materials and the liquid injection for soil adhesion. The prototype performances were tested by using soil bin test system. The performance parameters of holes, liquid injection, material and geometrical structure surface were taken into account to present the effects on drag-reducing and anti-soil adhesion in tests. The results showed that the significant influences of the performance parameters for drag resistance were as liquid injection > hole number > material > surface structure. The significant influences of the performance parameters for soil adhesion were surface structure > hole number > material > liquid injection. The optimal level of each parameter was the liquid injection, six holes, UHMWPE material and geometrical structural surface. The optimized prototype was selected from eight types of sub-soil liquid fertilizer injection devices, which was UHMWPE in material, with geometry structure surface and six liquid injection holes. In the same experiment conditions, the mean value of the drag resistance of the selected bionic prototype was 283.48 N, the mean weight of soil adhesion was 10.93 g, which was lower than that of other prototypes. This study provided technical references for the mechanization of sub-soil fertilizing engineering. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Liquid fertilizer management system for a compact hydroponic planter was developed. An EC (Electro Conductivity) sensor that calculates nutrient concentration value with a high accuracy with an error rate of 8.4 % by introducing an op-amp oscillator and an EC curved surface generated by the weighted least-squares method. A fertilizer addition device feeds stock solution to the planter by controlling air pressure of a pump to adjust the EC to a target value. Precise control of 1.7-% variance was achieved under various conditions. In total, our system can manage the EC with an error rate of 10 %. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The demand for organic foods is increasing globally, but a key limiting factor to the production of organic greenhouse produce is the lack of certified liquid fertilizers. In this experiment, four organic fertilizers were produced using either acidic extraction, anaerobic digestion or both of ensiled biomass of organic red clover and white mustard. The resulting fertilizers were applied to greenhouse-grown parsley either alone, or in combination with nitrogen (N)-enriched water produced by flushing acidic water with ammonia, to determine their effect on plant growth and the nutrient concentrations of parsley. Six combinations of fertilizer treatments were included in the greenhouse experiment. Three treatments received either fertilizers derived from acidic extraction, anaerobic digestion or both and three treatments received fertilizers derived from acidic extraction combined with N-enriched water. Conventional inorganic liquid fertilizer, chicken manure extract and no liquid fertilizer (only water) were added as control treatments. A higher N-min (ammonium and nitrate) to potassium (K) ratio was found in fertilizers after anaerobic digestion compared to acidic extraction. All organic fertigation treatments resulted in high pH, high K and chloride concentrations and high NH4/NO3 ratios in the root zone. In addition, high electrical conductivity (EC), P, K and Mg concentrations were found when only acidic extracted fertilizers were applied. Application of plant-based organic fertilizers without amending with N-enriched water resulted in biomass yields that were 21-26% lower than the inorganic fertigation control. However, fertigation with chicken manure extract, or a combination of fertilizer derived from acidic extraction and N-enriched water, resulted in similar plant growth as inorganic fertilizer. The lower yield from fertilizer derived from acidic extraction was due to elevated EC levels in the growing medium. Our results suggest that yield of greenhouse-grown parsley using either organic fertilizers combined with N-enriched water or chicken manure extract is similar to conventional fertilizer. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Single and multi-component fertilizers were used as a draw solution (DS) in forward osmosis (FO) to produce high-quality water from synthetic and seawater solution, eliminating the need for DS regeneration and reducing the operational energy. The effect of DS type, concentration, circulation flow rates on the FO water flux (WF), specific water flux (SWF), percentage water recovery (%Wrecovery), reverse salt flux (RSF) and percentage salt rejection (%R) were studied. The results showed that single fertilizer draw solution (SFDSs) produced higher WF (4.43 L/m2.h), %Wrecovery (30%) and RSF (60%) in comparison with multi-component draw solution (MCDS) with WF, %Wrecovery and RSF of 2.57 L/m2.h, 17% and 46%, respectively. DS with higher concentration produced the highest SWF and %Wrecovery and consumed less energy. MCDS with concentration of 200 g/L showed SWF in the range of 14.0 to 10.4 L/m2h and energy consumption of 0.312 kW/h m3 in comparison with 10 to 7.8 L/m2h and 0.23 kW/h m3 for MCDS with concentration of 100 g/L. Increasing the recirculation flow rate showed minimum effect on WF and up to 35% energy saving. Pure water extracted using liquid fertilizers utilizing the unique FO mass transport properties balanced nutrient requirement and the water quality parameters, thereby sustaining the aquaponics industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Because of low content of available iron (Fe) in soils and its poor mobility in plants, iron fertilization is necessary. Different forms of iron (mineral salts, chelates, nanomaterials) and fertilization strategies (soil and foliar application of solid or liquid fertilizers) are used. The effect of solid mineral fertilizers (A: a mixture of ammonium nitrate and dolomite; B: a mixture of ammonium nitrate and sulfate) enriched with iron sulfate was assessed during a three-year pot experiment. Iron addition did not change the yield of spring rape (first year) or maize (second and third year) significantly, and the effect on iron content in the plants was ambiguous. Fertilizer B with iron had the greatest yield-forming effect, increasing the yield of aboveground parts by 355–874%, and of roots by 211–692% in particular years. All fertilizers (especially containing sulfur) acidified the soil. After the experiment, pH of the soil fertilized with sulfur was 4.1, and of the unfertilized soil–5.2. Iron addition increased the content of mobile and exchangeable iron in the soil by 12–110% and 2–58%, respectively, but not the content of the fraction bound to MnOx. Combination of sulfur and iron fertilization has a potential to improve soil abundance and plant yield. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To satisfy the technical requirements of precise and deep application of liquid fertilizer in sowing period of maize, a toward-target spot application system of liquid fertilizer is proposed in this paper, and a liquid fertilizer spraying device is designed. The device consisted of valve body, pressure regulation spring, valve seat, valve core and nozzle. The initial deformation of pressure regulating spring can be changed by adjusting the length of the nozzle screwed into the valve body, so the contact pressure between valve core and valve seat is changed. The liquid fertilizer spraying device is mainly divided into two states when working, open and closed, which were determined by the liquid fertilizer pressure and the contact pressure (which was the pressure between valve core and valve seat). The liquid fertilizer spraying device closes when liquid fertilizer pressure is less than the contact pressure, and in contrast, the liquid fertilizer spraying device open, thus the operation process of intermittent discharge of the liquid fertilizer was achieved. Nozzle is a key component of the fertilizer application, and the shape and parameters of nozzle are important factors affecting the performance of the liquid fertilizer spraying device. In order to obtain the best nozzle shape and parameters, two-dimensional geometric models of different shaped nozzles, such as conical straight, conical and cylindrical, are established in ANSYS Fluent. The geometric model is meshed and boundary conditions such as entrance boundary, exit boundary and symmetrical boundary are set. In the calculation model, VOF (fluid volume) is used as the multiphase flow model, in which the initial phase is air and the second phase is liquid fertilizer. And RNG k-ε model is used for viscous model and standard wall function is used for near wall. The non-submerged jet process of the nozzle is simulated by the non-coupled solver SIMPLE (semi-implicit method for pressure linked equation) algorithm. The velocity and total pressure of different nozzles in the direction of the central axis and the radial are analyzed, and obtained the bundle performance of different nozzles. According to the simulation results, the cone shape is determined as the best nozzle shape. In order to evaluate the working performance of the liquid fertilizer spraying device, a conical nozzle is selected to establish a fluid simulation model. And taking the fertilization amount as the evaluation index, the pump pressure and nozzle diameter as the test factors, the two-factor and five-level full factors experiment is designed, and the nalysis of variance (ANOVA) is performed to find the influence of parameters. The simulation results show that the factors of pump pressure and nozzle diameter have significant effects on fertilization amount (P&lt;0.01), and the diameter of the nozzle has a greater influence than the pump pressure. A regression equation between the fertilization amount, the pump pressure and the nozzle diameter is established, and the R2 of the equation is 0.998. The bench experiments of liquid fertilizer spraying device with the nozzle diameters of 2.5 and 3.0 mm are carried out separately. The results show that the value of the fertilization amount increases gradually as the pump pressure increasing when the pump pressure is within the range of 0.2 to 0.6 MPa. The growth trend of the fertilization amount is basically consistent with the predicted value of the regression equation. The experiment value of fertilization amount average decreases by 1.62% (0.12 mL) than predicted value after the regression equation was corrected. The accuracy of the simulation model and the regression equation is verified. This study can lay a foundation for the further study of the toward-target spot application system of liquid fertilizer. © 2019, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - A variable rate of fertilizer according to plant demand and placement (50–100 mm deep) beside roots are essential principles for improving nitrogen use efficiency in growing crops. The objective of this study was to develop an injection dosing system that aligns with site-specific management of nitrogen fertilizer. The implementation considered a process that combines soil perforation and liquid fertilizer injection, which improves fertilizer uptake by the plant. Soil punching can provide nutrients near the plant roots, causing minimal disturbance to roots, crop residues and soil. Liquid fertilizer injection synchronized with soil punching at a variable fertilizer rate was the central idea applied in the design. Based on these requirements, an innovative injection dosing unit was developed. The hydraulic system was modeled inside the Simulink environment, which is linked to Matlab. The program considered the hydraulic elements (primary dimensions) and liquid fertilizer application conditions (forward speed, inter-row spacing of crops and liquid fertilizer rate, source and nutrient concentration). The outputs (simulations of outlet flow, dosage, hydraulic pressure and hydraulic power demand) were essential estimates that assisted in analysis and design. In general, the simulations were analogous to the experimental measurements. Dosage control was applied along a representative range (5–18 ml cycle−1) that allowed application using a variable rate. The liquid fertilizer was injected during soil perforation, from 50 to 100 mm deep. These characteristics can help implement better practices for nutrient stewardship, which are especially relevant for nitrogen fertilization in growing crops, such as sugarcane fields. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Indonesian's waste production continues to grow as the population increases. Organic waste such as leaves and food waste generally decomposes and can be composted simply with the use of barrels and buckets. Effective Microorganism 4 bioactivator can accelerate this process. This research was conducted to discover if addition of Tithonia diversifolia and chicken manure could increase the nutrients from liquid fertilizer and solid compost. Complete randomized design with 4 treatments and 4 replications was used as follows: A = 100% organic waste (control), B = 60% waste + 28% tithonia + 12% manure, C = 60% waste + 32% tithonia + 8% manure and D = 60% waste + 36% tithonia + 4% manure. The results showed that the addition of manure and tithonia increased N, P and K in liquid fertilizer. The highest increase in N and P occurred with treatment D, and K with treatment C. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: The article discusses the use of domestic liquid bioorganic fertilizer («BioEcoGum») in the cultivation of corn in the south-east of Kazakhstan. Objectives: The aim of the work is to study the effect of seed treatment and foliar feeding during the vegetation period on the growth, development and yield of grain maize. Material and Methods: Field production experience was conducted on light chestnut soils according to the generally accepted methodology of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Soil samples were taken before sowing and after harvesting. The soil content of organic matter (humus), pH, gross and mobile forms of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were determined to study the dynamics of the nutritional regime. Hydride «Porumbeni 458» (Moldova) was cultivated for grain maize. Phenological observations and grain yield history were carried out. Results: Presowing treatment of corn seeds with a solution of liquid bioorganic fertilizer «BioEcoGum» increases germination by 10-30%. Double-folded top dressing of corn plants enhances plant growth and development, increases grain yield up to 75%, contributes to an increase in root biomass by 50%. «BioEcoGum» liquid bioorganic fertilizer is produced from biocompost by enriching macro- and microelements in a form accessible to plants, which increases stress resistance, stimulates plant growth, and increases the grain yield of corn. Conclusion: According to the results of production tests, bioorganic liquid fertilizer «BioEcoGum» is recommended for widespread use in the southern regions of Kazakhstan when cultivating grain maize. © 2019 Suleimenov et al.

AB  - The storage of liquid substances like livestock slurry, liquid fertilizer, digested material and many others is an integral part of farms. The storage is realized in tanks with a volume of several cubic meters up to several thousand cubic meters. Various materials such as steel, reinforced concrete, plastics and combinations of these materials are used to construct such containers, less often wood or composite materials. Compared to the chemical industry, the stored substances are not toxic to the human body, and in the event of accidents, only minimal damage to human health is usually caused. Hazardousness of stored substances consist of harmfulness to the environment, mainly due to the high concentration of these substances. In particular, water resources are threatened, both surface water and underground drinking water sources. In general, agriculture is often overlooked sectors. Despite that it is a crucial sector for human existence. As is the case with the safety of operation of technological equipment. In the field of chemical industry hundreds of publications have been written on this subject; in the field of agriculture, these publications are rather an exception. Employees working in the chemical industry are regularly trained to deal with emergencies, with employees in the agricultural sector this is an exception. It is clear from various reports that the accident is not avoided even in this sector. The authors collected a total of 241 records of accidents resulting in leakage of stored material from the tanks. Relative number of accidents causes by human error is 17%, organizational causes 20.7%, external causes 20.7%, and other causes 14.1%. Unknown causes were found in 27.4%. The data were statistically processed and selected emergency scenarios was described in more detail. The output of the work is recommendations for the safe operation of storage tanks. © 2019

AB  - Fertility management of seedlings and transplants is considered a key challenge in organic greenhouse production. This study was conducted to determine response of greenhouse-grown cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and nutrient release profile to two organic fertilizers and their combinations applied at three different concentrations in organic substrate. The organic fertilizers used were a turkey litter–based compost (TC) and a dairy manure vermicompost (VC). In addition, two control treatments [no fertilization (CK), conventional liquid fertilizer (CF)] were included. For TC, substrate leachate pH decreased for the first 17 days after addition and then increased, whereas electrical conductivity (EC), and calcium (Ca) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 --N) concentrations increased and then declined. For VC, EC decreased continuously over time from days 0 to 52, whereas pH increased. The Ca and NO3 --N concentrations decreased over time to 24 days and then did not change further. For TC/VC combinations, EC was stable for the first 17 days and then declined. For all organic fertilizer applications, potassium concentration was stable for the first 17 days and then decreased, whereas most of the sodium, ammonium-nitrogen, and chloride were no longer leached by 24 days. The VC and TC/VC combinations did not affect cucumber seed germination rate, seedling survival rate, seedling height, and leaf greenness (SPAD) as compared with CF. The stem length, leaf number, dry weight (DW), root index, and SPAD readings of cucumber transplants increased with increasing TC and VC fertilizer applications. The TC/VC combinations increased the biomass of cucumber transplants compared with CK, and did not differ from CF. The results of this study indicated that the 28.32 lb/yard3 of VC (high rate) or the 9.44 lb/yard3 of VC combined with 4 lb/yard3 of TC (medium rate) can be substituted for CF for the cultivation of cucumber seedlings. Based on DW, the 12 lb/yard3 of TC (high rate) or the 4 lb/yard3 of TC combined with 9.44 lb/yard3 of VC (medium rate) fertilizers were suitable replacements for CF for the cultivation of cucumber transplants. © 2019, American Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Background: Experimental determination of the extent and rate of transport of liquid humates supplied to plants is critical in testing physiological effects of such biostimulants which are often supplied as foliar sprays. Therefore, an original experimental method for the qualitative investigation and quantitative description of the penetration of humates through plant cuticles is proposed, tested, and evaluated. Results: The proposed method involves the isolation of model plant leaf cuticles and the subsequent in vitro evaluation of cuticular humate transport. The employed novel methodology is based on a simple diffusion couple arrangement involving continuous spectrophotometric determination of the amount of penetrated humate in a hydrogel diffusion medium. Prunus laurocerasus leaf cuticles were isolated by chemical and enzymatic treatment and the rate of cuticular penetration of a commercial humate (lignohumate) was estimated over time in quantitative and qualitative terms. Different rates of lignohumate transport were determined for abaxial and adaxial leaf cuticles also in relation to the different cuticular extraction methods tested. Conclusions: The proposed methodology represents a simple and cheap experimental tool for the study on the trans-cuticular penetration of humic-based biostimulants. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigated the effects of applying anaerobically digested food waste and dairy manure-derived biofertilizers to processing tomatoes. The biofertilizers were produced from a pilot scale system consisting of coarse solid separation and ultrafiltration (5,000 Da) with a capacity of approximately 3.8 m3·d−1. The coarse solids had particle size &gt;53 μm and were not used for drip fertigation. The liquid concentrate and permeate from the system were both delivered to tomato plants through a subsurface drip fertigation system in a farm-scale cultivation experiment. The results showed that liquid digestate biofertilizers could be effectively delivered to the tomato plants given that steps to ensure suitable particle sizes were maintained prior to delivery. The ultrafiltered dairy manure digestate biofertilizer (DMP) had the highest yield of red tomatoes (7.13 ton·ha−1) followed by the concentrated food waste digestate biofertilizer (FWC) and mineral N fertilizer treatments with 6.26 and 5.98 ton·ha−1, respectively. The FWC biofertilizer produced tomatoes with significantly higher total and soluble solids contents compared to the synthetically fertilized tomatoes. Few significant differences between the treatments were observed among the pH, color, or size of the red tomatoes. These results indicate promise for the prospect of applying digestate biofertilizer products to tomatoes using the industry standard subsurface drip fertigation method. Additionally, digestate-derived biofertilizers may have potential to increase crop yields as well as certain quality characteristics of the harvested tomato fruit. No changes in soil quality were found among treatments but more study is required to understand long-term effects of biofertilizer applications with regards to soil quality and environmental risks. © Copyright © 2019 Barzee, Edalati, El-Mashad, Wang, Scow and Zhang.

AB  - Hyperthermophilic pretreatment (80 °C, 24 h) is a technology that promotes methane yield in the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge. However, little information is available on the characteristics of sludge anaerobically digested with hyperthermophilic pretreatment as a fertilizer and on the environmental impact of using the sludge as a fertilizer. In this study, we conducted incubation experiments to examine the characteristics of methane production and nitrogen mineralization in paddy soil treated with sludge from anaerobic digestion that was enhanced by hyperthermophilic pretreatment. Sludge samples digested under 15, 25, 30 and 35 °C with and without hyperthermophilic pretreatment were used. Sixty-mL vials were used in the experiment. Each vial was filled with 5 g of air-dried paddy soil, 10 mL of degassed water and digested sludge. It was then covered with a butyl rubber stopper, its headspace air was replaced by N2, and it was incubated at 30 °C. Methane concentrations in the headspace of the vials were measured after 7, 14, 28, 46, 57, 70 and 84 days. NH4-N concentrations in the soil were also measured after 0, 14, 28 and 84 days. The results indicated that relatively more methane tended to be produced in soil treated with sludge from anaerobic digestion that was enhanced by hyperthermophilic pretreatment than in non-pretreated sludge. On the other hand, a small amount of NH4-N was released from sludge digested with hyperthermophilic pretreatment at all digestion temperatures because organic nitrogen had been decomposed under hyperthermophilic pretreatment. Therefore, the appropriate application rate of sludge digested with hyperthermophilic pretreatment can be determined based on NH4-N in digested sludge without consideration of nitrogen mineralized after application when the sludge is used as a fertilizer. © 2019, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering.

AB  - Since there are some problems in the previous cam of deep-fertilization liquid fertilizer applicator, such as poor precision and low-fertilization performance, a method of the contour line of a cam was proposed based on Matlab GUI development platform. Bernoulli’ equation between the liquid fertilizer and the pressure valve of the fertilizer-spraying needle was founded. Moreover, the motion angles of a rise travel and return travel were corrected and the corresponding parameters of the contour line of the cam were obtained. Equations of cam moving from rise travel to return travel were derived according to the simple harmonic motion. In addition, 3D model of cam was established by applying the Pro/E software and the rationality of the cam design was verified. The static analysis of the cam was carried out under working conditions and the corresponding dynamics analysis was performed based on D’Alembert’s principle. And then relationships between the binding force and the drag torque were obtained. A bench test indicates that when the pressure of a hydraulic pump is 0.5 MPa and the velocity of a output shaft is 50 r/min, the average consumption of the fertilizer is 19.7 mL for each measurement, which meets the corresponding agronomic requirement, i.e. 20 mL. When the rotation angle of the cam is 8.6° and the rise displacement of a plunger is 0.84 mm, the mouth of the fertilizer-spraying needle sprayed liquid fertilizer as soon as it got into the soil and stopped spraying as soon as it got out of the soil. The results show that the designed contour line of the cam meets the requirement, that is, the mouth of the fertilizer-spraying needle should spray liquid fertilizer as soon as it gets into the soil and stop spraying as soon as it gets out of the soil, which meets the agronomic requirements, that is, fertilizer should be sprayed deeply and precisely. And this study lays theoretical foundation for designing the cam of intermittent type distributor and provides relevant parameters. © 2019, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - The purpose of this study is a field test of the use of Azolla mycrophylla as a cheap and high-quality alternative fertilizer in Indonesia that aims to assist the Indonesian government’s program in terms of national food security. The field test in this study involved two types of Azolla Mycrophylla namely wet and dry azolla, which were analyzed usinganalysis of variance (Anova) and Duncan’s advanced test at the level of 5%, analyzing the chemical composition of Azolla mycrophylla in various technological innovations either as compost or liquid fertilizer (POC) using wet azolla and dried azolla in itsapplication. The study found that the best treatment of compost Azolla was found in A3 treatment, namely azolla compost 96 g/polybag + 0.75 g urea/polybag, and the best treatment of liquid fertilizer Azolla is in the A4 treatment, namely the administration of Azolla mycrophylla POC 120 ml/l + 0.5 g urea/polybag. The average yield of variance showed the treatment of both the combination of Azolla mycrophylla compost and POC and urea significantly affected all parameters of observation. The results showed the combination treatment of both Azolla mycrophylla compost and Azolla mycrophylla POC can save the use of urea fertilizer which is needed to keep up with food demand but is also environmentally friendly. Both compost and POC Azolla mycrophylla have met thestandards of organic fertilizer for vegetables according to the Regulation of Ministry of Agriculture No. 28 of 2009. © 2019 International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research.

AB  - Biofertilizer production in Indonesia should fulfil the minimum requirement for being produced and released to the market. Problems occurred when those products are being absent on informing those expiration dates and the viability of microbial activity which then closely related to the quality of the product. Seaweed composted material are potential resources for producing Biofertilizer, but lacking on the optimization on their process as this material contain a various important component for soil and environment. The production of Biofertilizer from seaweed waste required an optimum condition, i.e.: pH and typical microbe which could germinate under specific formulation and temperature. This study aimed to determine the optimum pH in liquid fertilizer formulations made from seaweed waste in the form of composted material, to test the viability of three bacterial isolates and those pathogenicity properties, to examine the effect of metabolites release from bacterial isolates to green bean seed germination. The experimental design used was a completely randomized design with four treatments, which were as follow: P0 as a control (Peptone), RP1 (seaweed waste), RP2 (seaweed waste and glycerol), and RP3 (seaweed waste and PEG). The three bacterial isolates used were: (1) Bacillus licheniformis, (2) Psudomonas plecoglossicida and (3) Pantoea ananatis. This liquid fertilizer biological formulation was stored for 8 weeks at pH 5.5 and temperature 25oC. The results showed that the treatment of RP1 (seaweed waste) had high bacterial viability and could stimulate growth for green bean sprouts. The carrier material for seaweed waste with the addition of glycerol and PEG showed no effect of the disease and symptoms of a pathogenic bacterial consortium on germination of green beans. © 2019 Journal of Degraded and Mining Lands Management.

AB  - Plant nutrition serve as critical factors that influences plant growth and yield. Global fertilizer production and application is growing in surplus amounts, increasing the agricultural expenses and damaging the environment. Organic fertilizers, obtained from natural sources, encompass all essential plant nutrients. Application of aqueous seaweed extracts are regarded as potential plant biostimulant agents. The liquid seaweed extract of green seaweed Chaetomorpha antennina (CA-LSE) were evaluated for their biostimulant activity on seed germination and growth of tomato. The CA-LSEs were able to stimulate early emergence of tomato seeds, in addition to increasing their germination percentage and energy. They also exerted a positive influence on the vegetative growth, resulting in increased plant height, leaf-branch number and yield. The CA-LSEs were influence the plant's biochemical profile and displayed a linear increase in pigment contents (chlorophyll a & b and carotenoids), total soluble solids (TSS), phenols as well as ascorbic acid contents. The bio-stimulant potential was attributed to the elements present in CA-LSEs, elucidated by EDX analysis that revealed the presence of six elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Cl and Ca), that were essentially plant nutrients. These results support the bio-stimulant potential of C. antennina, which can be applied as a prospective bio-fertilizer that is economic, renewable, efficient and eco-friendly, and also can be regarded as a potential catalyst for the betterment of sustainable agricultural food production. © 2019

AB  - In previous study, the mixture of manure and sand have been tested successfully as media growth of local Jackfruit seedlings, called Tulo-5 and Beka-3 from Central Sulawesi area. It shows that the organic fertilizers are a good fertilizer to use. One of organic fertilizers in this study is liquid organic fertilizer (LOF) from Tilapia fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) waste. The process to produce LOF used "Bakasang fermentation technology" as a part of a local wisdom in North Sulawesi area. The objective of this research is to produce liquid organic fertilizer using this traditional fermentation technology and to analyze macro nutrient of N, P, K elements and micro nutrients of Zn, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Co elements by spectrophotometry method. The sample was divided into 3 parts for the analysis of the nutrients. The first part was based on macro and micro nutrient content after making the LOF. The second part was based on the kind of local Tilapia fish which were taken from Lindu Lake and Kabonena fresh water fish-culture area. The last, the LOF was made through Bakasang fermentation process with the bacterial feeding and without the bacterial feeding. From the study showed that the nutrient levels in most part of organic liquid fertilizer from the waste of Tilapia fish met the general quality standard levels of the LOF. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Conventional food processor was used as compost or feed after solid-liquid separation by crushing and compression. However, feedstuffs became difficult due to the inability to prevent toxic substances, and composting was reluctant to use inappropriately and excessively salty. Therefore, using food waste as its own heat source in the drying process will reduce fuel costs and provide new food treatment methods. The food waste that is rich in fat and protein is distilled and dried, the solid material is used as livestock feed, and the condensate is completely recycled as an external carbon source of deodorant or sewage treatment plant. At this time, the excess solid component is pyrolyzed in a vertical type carburetor, and a combustible gas is produced and burned to be utilized as a heat source of the food drying apparatus. The pyrolysis temperature of the dried food waste for making flammable gas was maintained at 400 ° C and in this case, the harmful gas was below the environmental standard. By maintaining 1200 ° C during combustion, the risk of dioxin was eliminated. The vertical carbonization system can be used as a solid fuel additive, a black gray concrete additive, a soil additive and the like, while the hydrocarbon gas produced by pyrolyzing the solid structure effectively is used as a clean fuel to reduce the fuel cost. Condensate is used as an external carbon source for liquid fertilizers, deodorizers and sewage treatment. This device is not necessary when using incinerator waste heat. In a food waste disposal facility in an area without an incinerator, the fuel can be self-sufficient and effectively reduce fuel costs. © BEIESP.

AB  - The hybrid membrane bioreactor - nanofiltration treatment process can be an effective approach for treating the landfill leachate, but the residual leachate concentrate highly loaded with the humic substance and salts remains an environmental concern. Herein, a loose nanofiltration membrane (molecular weight cut-off of 860 Da) was used to recover the humic substance, which can act as a key component of organic fertilizer, from the leachate concentrate. The loose nanofiltration membrane showed the high permeation fluxes and high transmissions (&gt;94.7%) for most inorganic ions (i.e., Na+, K+, Cl−, and NO3−), while retaining 95.7 ± 0.3% of the humic substance, demonstrating its great potential in effective fractionation of humic substance from inorganic salts in the leachate concentrate. The operation conditions, i.e., cross-flow rates and temperatures, had more pronounced impacts on the filtration performance of the loose nanofiltration membrane. Increasing cross-flow rates from 60 to 260 L h−1 resulted in an improvement of ca. 7.3% in the humic substance rejection, mainly due to the reduced concentration polarization effect. In contrast, the solute rejection of the nanofiltration membrane was negatively dependent on the temperature. The rejection of humic substance decreased from 96.3 ± 0.3% to 92.0 ± 0.4% with increasing the temperature from 23 to 35 °C, likely due to the enlargement of the membrane pore size and enhancement in solute diffusivity. The humic substance was enriched from 1735 to 15,287 mg L−1, yielding a 91.2% recovery ratio with 85.7% desalination efficiency at a concentration factor of 9.6. The recovered HS had significantly stimulated the seed germination and growth of the green mungbean plants with no obvious phytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that loose nanofiltration can be an effective promising technology to recover the humic substance as a valuable fertilizer component towards sustainable management of the landfill leachate concentrate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable fuels are necessary energy sources as bio-based combustible fuels can be utilized in existing infrastructure while lowering the dependence on petrochemical based fuels. Current bio-fuels are predominantly crop-based which require tillable land, fertilizer, chemicals, irrigation, and fuel to cultivate the biomass feedstock. This study investigated the hydrothermal conversion of underutilized waste streams for biomass feedstock. This work blended municipal sewage sludge solids, poultry dissolved air flotation solids, and used cooking oil to form a waste slurry that was thermally converted to renewable fuel products. Blended waste processing provides flexibility and robustness in the future of bio-based fuels, and the authors believe this is the first documented hydrothermal processing of this specific blended waste. The waste slurry was heated under subcritical hydrothermal conditions, where solids were separated, and then heated in a second pressurized reaction to complete the thermal conversion process of wastes to recoverable products. Prior to processing, the blended waste slurry contained 8,490 kJ/kg (3,650 BTU/lb). Following processing, the recovered gas products contained 38,747 kJ/kg (16,658 BTU/lb) and 42% methane. The recovered renewable oil contained 40,468 kJ/kg (17,398 BTU/lb) and 0.012% ash. The effluent produced water was appraised for nutrient content and was found to contain 1,689 mg/L of nitrogen, which has potential as a liquid fertilizer product. The produced gas fuel, produced liquid fuel, solid char, and produced nutrient laden water were determined to be potential marketable products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Plant growth and nitrogen (N) uptake of Encore® azalea ‘Chiffon’ (Rhododendron sp.) grown in a traditional plastic container or a biodegradable container made from recycled paper were investigated over the 2013 growing season. Three hundred twenty 1-year-old azalea liners, grown in two types of containers, were fertilized twice weekly with 250 mL Nfree liquid fertilizer with noNor 15mMN from ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3). Biweekly from 10 May to 3 Dec., five plants from each N rate and container type were selected randomly to measure plant height, widths, and leaf chlorophyll content in terms of soil-plant analysis development (SPAD) readings, and were then harvested destructively for nutrient analyses. Leaf SPAD readings and tissue N concentration were influenced mostly by N rate rather than container type, with 15 mM N producing greater values than the no-N treatment. Leaf SPAD readings increased fromMay to August and decreased from September to December. Using 15 mM N, plastic containers generally resulted in similar or increased plant growth [plant growth index (PGI) and dry weight] and N uptake from May to August as in biocontainers, with greater SPAD readings, leaf and root dry weights, stem and root N concentrations, and leaf and root N content than biocontainers at some harvests. However, biocontainers resulted in greater PGI, dryweights, andNcontent (in leaves, stems, roots, and total plant) than plastic containers later in the season, from September to December. These differences appeared in September after plants grown in plastic containers ceased active growth in dry weight and N uptake by the end of August. Plants grown in biocontainers had extended active growth from 13 Sept. to 9 Nov., resulting in greater tissue N content and greater N uptake efficiency. The biocontainers used in this study produced azalea plants of greater size, dry weight, and improved N uptake by increasing growth rate and extending the plants’ active growth period into late fall. The beneficial effects likely resulted from greater evaporative cooling through container sidewalls and the lighter color of the biocontainers, and therefore led to lower substrate temperatures and improved drainage. © 2019, American Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Hydrogen gas has been successfully produced from cultivated microalgae biomass by supercritical water gasification (SCWG). This paper describes SCWG of natural cyanobacterial biomass for hydrogen production at low temperatures (&lt;500 °C). Natural decomposition of cyanobacteria biomass was first studied to achieve prospective H2 production. Transformation of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus and the degradation of microcystins were also clarified for the nature and safety assessment of SCWG products. Cyanobacteria would remain an ideal SCWG feedstock for H2 production such as cultivated microalgae biomass, and it could be gasified as 2.92 mol/kg of H2 yield without any catalyst addition at 500 °C. Liquid products with above 2800 mg/L ammonia-nitrogen and 100% removed microcystins had great potential for producing high-quality liquid fertilizers. C (50.50%) was concentrated into a solid residue as char and tar. The percentage of P combined with Ca2+ and turned into authigenic apatite was as high as 72.25%. The synergistic effects of ash, N element, or proteins, and fixed carbon content make cyanobacteria a more optimistic feedstock for H2 production than some other types of organic wastes. The SCWG technology provides an effective method of gasification of waste cyanobacteria for high-value energy utilization. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A proprietary Flavonol Polymer Technology (FPT), designed by AgroLiquid, is an agent for encapsulating different chemistries on the polymer by impregnation to provide extended release of nutrients and optimize yield. Based on FPT, FPT-Product (Pro-Germinator®) a 9-24-3 (% N, % P2O5, and % K2O w/w) manufactured to slow the phosphorus release process in soil and extends its usability by the plant. Phosphorus release was evaluated using micro-lysimeters installed in soil and used as a tool for the collection of the plant-usable phosphorus dissolved in the soil solution. A rate of 22 kg of P2O5/hectare of liquid formulations was banded in-furrow with four phosphorus liquid fertilizer treatments: (1) orthophosphate (9-18-9), (2) ammonium polyphosphate (10-34-0), (3) FPT-Product (9-24-3), and (4) a control. In-field measurements were collected at 20–60 days after the application for two successive years (2015 and 2016). In both years, averages of measured dissolved phosphorus in the soil solution and exchangeable soil phosphorus at 10-cm soil depth, 20–60 days after planting reported higher values in the FPT-Product treatments while lower values were measured in the other treatments. The results proved that the FPT extended the release mechanism for phosphorus in the FPT-Product at 10 cm depth in the soil, and rendered phosphorus in both the soil and the solution to be used by plants for an extended period after corn planting. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In Indonesia, livestock urine is considered as waste, while weed of Choromolaena odorata, which are very toxic to ruminants is abundant in grassland area. These two materials have great potential to improve soil fertility because they can be made to organic fertilizer through fermentation. Fermentation of mixed urine, Chromolaena, and water with the proportion of 25:25:50% added with a small proportion of yeast tape, a liquid fertilizer produced with nutrient contents of N, P2O5, and K2O was 2.30, 0.32 and 0.15%, respectively. The research results showed that the application of liquid fertilizer significantly improved (P <0.01) the growth and biomass production of Panicum maximum, Brachiaria decumbens and Pennisetum purpureum whether Panicum maximum showed the best response. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - The current demilitarization processes employ open burning/open detonation which is not permitted by the environmental protection agency. Therefore, a systematic study has been carried out to convert waste/rejected nitramine propellant (NP) and fuel-rich-based propellant (FRP) into liquid fertilizer by digesting in dilute nitric acid followed by neutralization with potassium hydroxide and phosphoric acid. The obtained liquid fertilizers were fully characterized for nitrate, phosphate and ammonium ions along with potassium. Further, the effect of liquid fertilizers of NP and FRP on cluster bean plants was studied by taking different concentrations from 25 to 150 mL, and their effects on germination pattern, shoot growth, thickness of stem, size and number of leaves, number of pods and length over a full-grown period of plants were investigated. The results reveal that the germination index increases as the content of liquid fertilizer increases and the same trend was observed with respect to root and shoot growth. Also, broadness and the number of leaves showed an encouraging effect as concentration increases. Further, the final product, i.e. the number of pods of cluster bean and length in each pod was found to be more for liquid fertilizer of NP compared to FRP-based liquid fertilizer. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A research on the grafting of potato and black nightshade plants can be a new interesting report. This research was carried out in the greenhouse of Horticultural Seed Center Station in Pakem, Yogyakarta, Indonesia at an altitude of 780 m above sea level. In this research, a potato plant was used as the rootstock while a black nightshade plant was used as the scion. This research was conducted to examine the effect of grafting on tuber formation and endophyte dynamic of potato-black nightshade grafted with an application of liquid fertilizer made from goat manure. The plants consisted of three levels: potato plants, grafted plants, and black nightshade plants. Liquid fertilizer application consisted of two levels: without liquid fertilizer application, and with liquid fertilizer application. The liquid fertilizer was applied once a week in the range concentration of 1900-2000 μSCm-1 with total volume 0.5 liter per plants. Tuber formation was affected not only by the grafting of the plants but also by liquid fertilizer application. Potato with liquid fertilizer application produced the highest weight of tubers. There were about 66 % of grafted plants that produced tubers with sprouts, around 21.5% that produced irregular tubers and 12.5 % that produced regular tubers. Application of liquid fertilizer resulted a larger total bacteria in potato plants, in black nightshade plants, as well as in grafted plants. A population of bacteria in grafted plants was accumulated more in the connected stem, whereas the total of bacteria in the lower connected stem (rootstock) was larger than that in the upper connected stem (scion). © 2019, Asian Journal of Agriculture and Biology.

AB  - SUMMARY. High-value vegetable crops such as bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) are heavily fertilized by growers who seek to maximize yields. Field experiments were conducted in Spring 2016 and 2017 evaluating two liquid fertilizers with and without calcium (Ca), applied at three nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) levels in two varieties of bell pepper to determine whether current fertilizer recommendations were adequate and whether fertilizer source impacted fruit yield and quality. Plants were grown using plastic mulch and drip irrigation following standard production practices for the region. Two liquid fertilizer programs [7N–0P–5.8 (7–0–7) and 4N–0P–6.6K/9N–0P–0K–11Ca (4–0–8/CN9)] were applied twice weekly at three N rates (175, 200, and 225 lb/acre N). Yield, cull rate, and foliar nutrient concentrations were measured. In 2016, total marketable yields were greatest [910 boxes/acre (28 lb/box)] and blossom end rot (BER) incidence (14.4%) lowest in plants grown with the supplemental Ca (4–0–8/C9 fertilizer) at 175 lb/acre N. Cull rates increased in plants grown without supplemental Ca during the season (7– 0–7 fertilizer), with BER incidence ranging from 22.9% to 27.2%. Yields ranged from 590 to 740 boxes/acre in plants grown without supplemental Ca in 2016. In 2017, yields ranged from 530 to 790 boxes/acre in plants grown with supplemental Ca at 200 and 175 lb/acre N, respectively. Culls due to BER were lower in 2017 than in 2016. In 2016, BER incidence was greater in ‘PSO9979325’ compared with ‘Antebellum’, despite no differences in total yield. Foliar nutrient levels were largely unaffected by fertilizer program; however, foliar N and K concentrations increased with the rate of N and K fertilization. The results of this study suggest that using liquid fertilizer program containing some Ca may benefit bell pepper growers in some, but not all, growing seasons. © 2019, American Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - The University of Lampung is located in the City of Bandar Lampung. Like many other cities in Indonesia, the city is still having difficulty in solving the waste problems. Meanwhile, the university generates waste of 14.7 tons per day (24.5 m3 per day). The waste produce at university commonly rich in organic content, which is has the potential to be processed into bio-methane. Answering the challenge of implementing a decentralization and zero waste policies, helping to ease the burden of government in handling waste as well as considering the potential of rich organic content of waste, the University of Lampung set up a plan to develop a campus community integrated waste management and carry out innovation in waste processing by utilizing a Biomass Power Plant (Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Biomasa or PLTBM). The advantage of PLTBM is while converting organic waste into energy (electricity and gas), it produces solid and liquid fertilizer as its byproduct. This paper presents the feasibility study of the plan, specifically on technical aspect. The study was assessed by comparing the condition with and without project. The result of this study can be used by university stakeholders to take actions to make this plan work properly. The plan is expected to improve the campus environment quality, divert 80% of waste being dump into landfill as well as can be a pilot model for a wider communities. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The nitrogen load on urban wastewater should be considered as a secondary resource for nitrogen-based fertilizers. From this point of view, ammonia-rich streams obtained from a regeneration step with zeolites using 70–80 g NaOH/L could contain up to 3.5–4.5 g NH3/L as well as other ionic species (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Thus, they could be treated to obtain a valuable product composed by ammonia for fertilizing applications. A sorption pre-treatment process was carried out to remove the residual amount of DOM and to reduce membrane fouling before processing with hollow fibres liquid-liquid membrane contactors (HF-LLMC). Polypropylene HF-LLMC was used to selectively extract ammonia in single or two-step configurations using different acid stripping solutions (H3PO4, HNO3 or a mixture of HNO3/H3PO4). For ammonia recovery, the ammonia mass transfer coefficient (Km(NH3)) and water transport by HF-LLMC were determined. H3PO4 was found to be the best acid stripping solution by one-step HF-LLMC; the ammonia removal was 76% with a Km(NH3) of 8.8 × 10−7 m/s. Additionally, the ammonia was concentrated 26 times, and it was recovered as multi-nutrient liquid fertilizer (NP) composed of 7.8% N and 21.6% P2O5. Furthermore, ammonia recovery was increased, reaching values up to 94%, through two-step HF-LLMC, and again H3PO4 was used as stripping solution. Finally, water transport from the feed to the stripping phase was estimated to be 0.022 L/m2·h for one-step HF-LLMC with H3PO4. Finally, the use of UV–Vis and 2D-Fluorescence was shown to be a successful approach for monitoring pore wetting events. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study compared the relative effectiveness of two products recently introduced as nitrification inhibitors with other materials used to inhibit nitrification. Four soils were treated with 0, 0.2, 1, 5, and 25 mg kg −1 of nitrapyrin (NP), a new microencapsulated nitrapyrin product (ENP), dicyandiamide (DCD), a new maleic-itaconic polymer product (MIP), and ammonium thiosulfate (ATS). The soils were also treated with 200 mg N kg −1 as urea, and percent inhibition of nitrification determined after 2 or 4 weeks of incubation. After 4 weeks, similar levels of nitrification inhibition were provided by 1 mg kg −1 of NP (72%), 5 mg kg −1 of ENP (79%), and 25 mg kg −1 of DCD (73%), averaged across soil. After 4 weeks with a sandy soil, the highest rate of MIP and ATS provided 15 and 36% inhibition, respectively. MIP and ATS were ineffective at inhibiting nitrification when added to the other three soils.

AB  - Knowing actual nutrient requirements for rice plants is crucial in supplying the correct amount of fertilizer, especially nitrogen since nitrogen is one of the most key limiting nutrients in rice cultivation. A preliminary study of variable rate application (VRA) on System of Rice Intensification (SRI) planting by using organic foliar fertilizer was carried out to determine the effectiveness of precision fertilization. Foliar fertilizer was formulated based on actual nitrogen needed by rice plants using Soil-Plant Analyses Development (SPAD) chlorophyll meter measurements. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four treatments (50% fixed rate, 100% fixed rate, 150% fixed rate and VRA) and four replications for each treatment. Plant growth performances (plant heights, number of tillers, number of panicle and flower) and yield performances (grain yield, number of grain, 1000-grain weight and number of spikelets) were recorded during the study. The results showed that foliar application of VRA resulted in significantly higher yield performances; grain yield (13.65 g), number of grain (807.50), 1000-grain weight (16.79 g), and number of spikelets (7.50) compared to uniform fertilizer applications. VRA treatments had the highest SPAD readings at every planting stage during the experiment; however, a high nitrogen supply was needed during the mid-tillering stages (35 DAT) compared to other fertilizer rates. Besides, VRA application shows the most savings in term of total nitrogen supply (415 µg) compared to uniform rates application; 50% fixed rate (400 µg), 100% fixed rate (810 µg), and 150% fixed rate (1210 µg). © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The processing of organic wastes and composts by worms results in castes and vermiliquer (i.e., vermicompost leachate). Both castes and vermiliquer contain plant available nutrients, the latter better suited to hydroponic operations, but the optimum pH for worm productivity and vermiliquer production makes the latter too alkaline for hydroponics. We show that under optimal hydroponic management practices, the growth and yield of pak choi (Brassica chinensis) based entirely on pH buffered vermiliquer collected after 8–10 weeks of vermicomposting was comparable with those treated with a conventional inorganic hydroponic fertiliser. Nitric acid proved to be a superior pH buffer compared with orthophosphoric acid. The total fresh weight in the nitric acid buffered vermiliquer treatments ranged from 70% to 98% of the total fresh weight of the control. However, the non-buffered hydroponic production of pak choi using off-line (batch) vermiliquer or direct linkage with vermifarms was not successful. There were no statistically significant differences between pak choi yields using vermiliquer from kitchen wastes or composted paunch materials. A 50% dilution of vermiliquer led to yield loss, but less proportionately than the dilution, and the use of pot hydroponics rather than nutrient film technique (NFT) hydroponics led to a better performance of pak choi under less favourable conditions. This is the first report of comparable yields between vermiliquer treatments and an inorganic nutrient source and highlights the feasibility and commercial potential of this hydroponic practice. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of the organo-mineral foliar fertilization and the environment in the lettuce crop. The work was carried out in a soil classified as Quartzipsamments, with loam texture and low initial availability of nutrients. The experimental design used was randomized blocks with a factorial arrangement 2 x 2 x 5, corresponding to two cultivars of lettuce (Crisp Vanda and Crisp Lucy Brown), two environments (with and without shading mesh at 35%) and five concentrations of Ferti Garden liquid fertilizer multipurpose via foliar, (0; 5; 10; 15 and 20% of the product in the solution), with 4 repetitions, containing 20 plants. Soil preparation was done manually and fertilized with 30 m 3 hectare -1 of bovine manure, dead cover was also used. The foliar fertilizer was applied three times, at intervals of seven days, through a constant pressure sprayer, from 12 days after transplanting the seedlings. At 33 days after the transplant the plants were harvested and evaluated in the variables of head diameter, number of leaves, fresh matter and productivity. The cultivar Crisp Lucy Brown proved to be more demanding in terms of luminosity and mineral nutrition in relation to the cultivar Crisp Vanda. Therefore, the highest development and productivity of the Crisp Lucy Brown cultivar is obtained without shading mesh, with fertilization before sowing of 30 kg ha -1 of fowl bed and fertilization with 9.1% of the foliar fertilizer. While for the cultivar Crisp Vanda the highest productivity is obtained with shading mesh, and only with fertilization before sowing. © 2019, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Perennial hibiscus (Hibiscus sp.) are popular summer-flowering plants that are grown in greenhouses or nurseries, where growers must optimize production inputs such as fertility to maximize plant growth and produce high-quality flowering crops. The objective of this study was to determine the optimum fertilizer concentrations, identify leaf tissue nutrient sufficiency ranges by chronological age, and to expand leaf tissue nutrient standards of Hibiscus hybrid L. (hibiscus) grown in soilless substrates during container production. Two cultivars of hibiscus (H. hybrid L. ‘Mocha Moon’ and ‘Starry Starry Night’) were grown under one of six constant liquid fertilizer concentrations [50, 75, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg·L-1 nitrogen (N)] with a constant level of water-soluble micronutrient blend in a greenhouse. The fertilizer concentrations sufficient for optimal plant growth and development were determined by analyzing plant height, diameter, growth index (GI), primary shoot caliper (PSC), and total dry mass, and they were found to be 100-300 mg·L-1 N after an 8-week crop cycle. Recently, mature leaf tissue samples were collected and analyzed for elemental content of 12 nutrients at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after transplant (WAT) from plants fertilized with 100-300 mg·L-1 N. An overall trend of increasing sufficient tissue concentration over time was observed for total N, phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and boron (B), whereas a decreasing trend was observed for potassium (K), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and aluminum (Al). For instance, at 2 WAT, total N ranged from 3.1% to 5.1% N and increased to a range of 4.2% to 4.7% N at 8 WAT. At 2 WAT, Fe and Mn ranged from 79.2 to 103.6 mg·L-1 Fe and 66.3-82.8 mg·L-1 Mn and decreased to ranges of 75.6-82.9 mg·L-1 Fe and 18.1-99.7 mg·L-1 Mn at 8 WAT, respectively. Optimal leaf tissue concentration sufficiency ranges determined in this scientifically-based study were narrower than previously reported survey values for the genera Hibiscus. © 2019, American Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - The aims of this research is to analyze the quality of fermented cow urine, derived from Ngabab village, Pujon, Kab. Malang. The quality of fermented urine was determined from the concentrations of N, P, K, and ammonia (as NH3), using commercially available EM-4 and local microorganisms resulting from organic waste. The fermentation was conducted using 6 different ratios. They were: (1) urine: EM-4 = 2:1; (2) urine: EM-4 = 4:1; (3) urine: EM-4: organic waste = 4:1:1; (4) urine: table sugar: organic waste = 4:1:1; (5) urine: EM-4: table sugar = 10:5:1; and (6) urine only. Results showed that composition 1 resulted in the highest N content, while ratio 1 resulted in the highest P and K contents. Interestingly, the highest C organic achieved in the method 6, where urine fermented without any additives. In general, these results suggested that cow urine fermentation could be one of the green techniques to produce chemical fertilizer and pesticides which are environmentally harmful. Furthermore, the use of local microorganisms from organic waste can be considered as substitute for commercially available EM-4. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Alkaline hydrolysis was used to develop a liquid fertilizer which was then applied to hot pepper plants in field in order to assess its potential to be used as a fertilizer. The treatments were control (Cn), developed liquid fertilizer (DLF), inorganic fertilizer (NPK), and DLF + NPK treatments. The chemical properties of the final DLF product were a pH of 10.2, TN of 2.26%, and K of 6.12%, respectively. The length and weight of the plant in hot pepper cultivation were higher in the order of DLF + NPK > NPK > DLF > Cn treatment. The fresh weight of hot pepper under DLF + NPK treatment increased by 312% compared to control. Although the DLF showed a significant increase in fruit length and fruit fresh weight in the hot pepper cultivation compared to the control, the effect of DLF treatment on plant growth was limited due to the unbalanced N-to-P ratios in the DLF. In the potting experiment, the DLF could potentially be used as a supplement to inorganic fertilizer, demonstrating that alkaline hydrolysis is a promising technique for recycling bio-hazardous materials such as infected animal carcasses into value-added liquid fertilizer. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Utilization and management of biomass residues are important global issues to ensure sustainability in agricultural production. Among biomass residues, a feather is one of the excellent raw materials for fertilizer because it has high nitrogen (N) content. Through hydrolysis, liquid feather hydrolysates could be obtained that are potentially desirable for use in agriculture practices. However, knowledge about the nutrient-release characteristics of liquid hydrolysates from organic materials in relation to production process parameters is lacking. In this study, four liquid feather hydrolysates produced by hydrothermal treatment (HTT) under various temperatures and one commercial liquid fertilizer were added to two adjacent soils and evaluated for N mineralization behavior in a 30-day incubation study. At the end of the incubation, the net N mineralization for hydrolysate-amended kuroboku soil was in the range of 34%–43% and for hydrolysate-amended paddy soil was in the range of 38%–51%. Soil type strongly influenced the net N mineralization more than the fertilizer treatments. For all treatments and soils, NH4-N content increased while NO3-N content remained constant, indicating delayed nitrification. The first-order exponential model expressed the rate of N mineralization, in which the parameters indicated that HTT products obtained at a higher temperature mineralize faster than ones obtained by a lower-temperature treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aquaculture has experienced a burgeoning growth worldwide in the last decade resulting in nearly 50% of seafood originating from aquaculture farms. However, there are less studies on the utilization of the manure produced by aquatic organisms in comparison to warm-blooded livestock. Aquaponics offers more efficient utilization of nutrients and can reduce the operational costs in aquaculture. This paper presents the results of a study to identify the optimal settings to digest fish manure through a microbial-assisted aerobic bioprocess, using endogenous heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria. The effects of pH (5.5, 6.0 and 6.5), temperature (30, 35 and 40 °C) and duration (1–30 days) on kinetics of nitrogen mineralization were investigated and compared to a control bioreactor (carried out without pH adjustment). The mineralization dynamics for all pH-controlled bioreactors revealed that only ammonification occurred. No nitrification was observed for all three-temperature conditions and throughout the entire bioprocessing period. The mineralization process in the control bioreactor, on the other hand, followed the typical non-inhibited nitrogen mineralization (i.e., release of ammonium followed by oxidation into nitrate). However, nitrate was only observed at temperatures &lt;40 °C indicating a complete suppression of nitrification at higher temperatures. Analytical data and modeled parameters indicated that the bioprocessing of aquaculture solid waste for 15 days at 35 °C using either pH 6.0 or 6.5 maximized nitrogen bioconversion in the form of ammonium ions (NH4 +). This study indicates the importance of temperature and pH optimization for more efficient processing of aquaculture solid waste such as fish manure. © 2018

AB  - The raw materials of liquid fertilizer production are cellulose. Hence, cellulases are needed as biocatalisator of liquid fertilizer production. Cellulases are produced by cellulolytic microbes, bacteria and fungi. Soil is a habitat dominated by microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoa. Isolation of cellulolytic bacteria was done by using a screening medium containing 1% CMC. Cellulolytic bacteria was selected based on clear zone which form surrounding the colonies. Cellulase activity was measured by dinitrosalisilic acid (DNS) method. In this research, microorganisms that produce cellulases have been isolated from the soil of agricultural waste, and one with the highest activity has been studied for its benefits as a biocatalytic candidate in the production of liquid fertilizer. It was observed four isolates of microorganisms producing cellulases, the widest clear zone produced by NH1 isolate had diameter of 19.69 ± 0.3 mm. The optimum pH and temperature of crude extracts of cellulases were 8.0 and 60°C, respectively. The total nitrogen level in the production of liquid fertilizer with and without crude extracts of cellulases are 0.2073% and 0.1104%, respectively. So this crude extracts of cellulases increase 87,77% of total nitrogen level. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Liquid fertiliser contains nutrient compounds that could be applied as plant enhancer and are used in urban agriculture as it does not require soil medium and environmentally friendly. An organic liquid fertilizer can be produced from bio-wastes composting as it contains more organic nutrients that are essential to promote healthy plant growth. Liquid fertiliser can be collected during the composting process (compost leachate) or by mixing compost with a certain solution (compost tea). Both the end solid and liquid fertilizer compost could be commercialised as organic fertilisers. Although there are a lot of studies regarding the nutrient characteristic of the end product compost and liquid fertiliser, the correlation of nutrient composition between liquid fertiliser and solid compost is unclear. The variation of waste input creates an unclear nutrient range of end compost in both solid and liquid products. This study aims to develop a correlation between the nutrients available in the liquid fertilizer (both compost leachate and compost tea) with regards to the nutrients available in the end solid compost from different bio-waste source. Based on the physical and nutrient characterisation, liquid fertiliser contains elements such as nitrogen (N), potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) that are essential for plant growth. Due to high organic content in the liquid fertiliser, dilution or pre-treatment is needed to avoid plant and soil damage. By using a graphical analysis and simple linear regression model, a formula can be developed to predicting the nutrient composition of the compost products. The formula allows predicting the nutrient composition of the compost by analysing the liquid fertiliser and save the cost and time of the analysis. Copyright © 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

AB  - In this article, a variable rate liquid fertilizer applicator for deep-fertilization based on ZigBee technology was elaborated. A host computer with remote control software and a STM32F103RET6 microcontroller were combined to measure and control the liquid fertilizer output: monitoring the liquid fertilizer level and collection the liquid flow information by the flow meter, and an incremental PID control algorithm was used to dynamically adjust the converter frequency for reaching the set liquid fertilizer flow accurately. Through the field test, the influence of parameters, such as fertilization depth, frequency of inverter, pressure of fertilizer injection, and the valve opening for water return of liquid fertilizer pump, on precise flow control is analyzed, and the mathematical model is established by using experimental data. The results showed that, the applicator accuracy is able to reach 99.52% and the liquid fertilizer consumption in each fertilization process is within 0.2L.min-1, with the fertilizer application depth changing, the maximum flow output difference is within 0.2L.min-1 and the inverter frequency difference is within 1Hz. When the valve opening for back water is 40%, the system works most stable and the flow output error is the smallest. © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted in autumn season of 2018-19 at farmers’ field in Azzawi area of Babil province in Iraq. The experiment was conducted in split-split plot randomized complete block design. The treatment combinations consisting of two broad bean varieties viz., V1 (LUZ De Otono) and V2 (Aqaudulce), three dates of liquid fertilizer spray i. e. D1 (15th November, 2018), D2 (15th December, 2018) and D3 (15th January, 2019) and three concentrations of liquid fertilizers i. e. F0 (No spray, control), F1 (10 mg/l) and F2 (20 mg/l) were allotted in experimental plots with complete randomization. The growth and yield parameters of faba bean were significantly affected by varieties, liquid fertilizer application time and concentration. The number of pods per plant significantly increased from 15.73 under F0 treatment of liquid fertilizer spray concentration to 27.22 pods per plant under F3 spray concentration. The weight of 100 seeds significantly increased from 52.43 g in V2 variety under F0 treatment of liquid fertilizer spray concentration to 85.17 g under F2 treatment in V1 variety. The seed yield per plant significantly increased from 47.63 g under F0 liquid fertilizer spray concentration to 59.49 g under F3 treatment. The protein content in seed of faba bean significantly increased from 22.91% under F0 liquid fertilizer spray concentration to 23.71% under F2 treatment. On the basis of these results, it is recommended that faba bean variety LUZ De Otono can be grown successfully in Azzawi area of Babil province in Iraq. © 2019, Gaurav Society of Agricultural Research Information Centre.

AB  - Leaf surface fertilization with liquid fertilizer produced from amino acids constitutes a potentially important source of nitrogen and is important for plant production. However, few reports have focused on the plant growth promotion by novel liquid fertilizers created by new amino acid resources, let alone the influence on leaf microbiota. In this study, the effects of liquid fertilizer, created by amino acids hydrolyzed from animal hairs with or without the PGPR strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9, on crop yield and leaf microbiota were investigated. The results showed that leaves sprayed with amino acid liquid fertilizer (AA) and liquid biological fertilizer (AA9) persistently increased cowpea yields compared to the control amended with chemical fertilizer (CF). Fertilization with amino acid fertilizer showed no significant difference in microbial composition compared with the CF treatment; however, the introduction of functional microbes altered the microbial composition. Pearson correlation analysis, VPA analysis and SEM models all revealed that the amino acids liquid fertilizer application, but not the functional strain or the altered microbiota, performed as the direct driver attributing to yield enhancement. We conclude that leaf fertilization with a novel amino acid liquid fertilizer can greatly enhance the crop yield and that the addition of beneficial microbes may perform the role in further altering the composition of leaf microbiota. © 2019 Wang et al.

AB  - Background and Objective: In Indonesia, most of the population relies on rice as their main staple food; however, the production of rice is dependent on inorganic fertilizers which not only increase cost production but also decrease soil fertility and pollutes the environment. Therefore, the development of organic fertilizers derived from natural resources which are more affordable with high bioavailability has recently become an important study. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of solid and liquid macroalgae extract on growth and yield of rice plants. Materials and Methods: The treatments consist of solid, liquid extract of brown macroalgae, such as Sargasum crassifolium, Sargasum cristaefolium, Sargasum aquifolium and Turbinaria murayana, combined solid form of all algae species and combined liquid form of all algae species. Treatments were conducted in 8 weeks, followed by measurements of vegetative growth and yield of rice plants. Results: The results show that solid and liquid extracts have different efficacy on growth and yield of rice plants. Application of macroalgae solid fertilizer increased vegetative growth; such as number of leaves and tillers in rice plants compared to liquid fertilizer treatments. Interestingly, macroalgae liquid fertilizer proved to be more effective in promoting yield based on shoot/root (S/R) ratio. However, 1000 seed weight of rice plants were not affected by fertilizer treatments. Conclusion: Nevertheless, current study provides effectiveness of macroalgae liquid fertilizer compared to solid fertilizers. Further evaluation of macroalgae fertilizer mechanism in promoting growth and yield of rice plants would be necessary for utilization in various agricultural industries. © 2019 Haji Sunarpi et al.

AB  - The study entitled "Development of a liquid fertilizer application system for planting mechanism" was conducted in the laboratory as well as on field at ASPEE Agricultural Research Foundation, Tansa, Tal- Wada, Dist.- Palghar. Fertilizer is any organic or inorganic material that is added to soil to supply one or more plant nutrients essential to the growth of plants. Conservative estimates report 30 to 50% of crop yields are attributed to fertilizer. Fertilizer is a key player to enhance crop production by upgrading soil fertility. Liquid fertilizer application has many advantages over solid fertilizer application. Hence, For greatest fertilizer nutrient use efficiency it is important to select the right source, the right timing, the right rate and the right method of application, it can be achieved by developing a mechanism which will place the seed in soil and also precisely apply fertilizer in liquid form at root zone of crop at required rate and discharge. The various components of liquid fertilizer application mechanism such as furrow openers, frame, power transmission system for seed drill, ball valve, liquid tank etc were designed and developed. The prototype was then tested and evaluated in laboratory by calibrating the ball valve for the required discharge at particular given tractor speed(3.5 km/h, 4.0 km/h and 4.5 km/h), pump pressure(1 kg/cm2, 2 kg/cm2 and 3 kg/cm2) and knob position(1, 2 and 3) of ball valve. The optimum requirement of liquid to be applied per meter length was 61-65 ml, hence the maximum value in the optimum range was observed at speed 3 (4.5 km/h), pressure 1 (1 Kg / cm2) and knob position 3 as 64.4 ml. © Copyright International Knowledge Press.

AB  - Many, if not most, pesticides are not compatible with liquid fertilizers. The goal of the research presented in this paper was to develop a dispersant system that would allow the direct dilution of suspension-based agrochemical formulations into undiluted fertilizer. To evaluate the compatibility of dispersant systems with fertilizer, a series of surrogate fertilizers, based on ammonium phosphate solutions, was used with a variety of ionic strengths and pHs. Baseline performance was established with typical dispersant systems, and then a variety of electrolyte-tolerant surfactant systems was evaluated for improved compatibility performance. The most promising combinations of surfactants were evaluated in commercial fertilizer products of varying N-P-K (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) composition, pH, and micronutrients. A blend of surfactants was developed that shows robust compatibility with the set of commercial fertilizer products and compared favorably to a commercially available fertilizer-tolerant suspension.

AB  - An cation-exclusion/anion-exchange chromatography (IEC/AEC) with conductimetric/UV-spectrophotometric detections for simultaneous determinations of the ionic nutrients (NO– 3, NO– 2, NH+ 4, HPO2– 4 and K+) required for important elements for plant growth was studied on a hydrophilic polymer-based strongly basic anion-exchange resin column and a dilute NaOH eluent. Under the optimized eluent conditions (3.5 mM NaOH at 0.6 mL/min), the simultaneous separation and detection of the anions (NO– 3, NO– 2, HPO2– 4, Cl–, SO2– 4) and the cations (K+, NH+ 4) was achieved in ca. 25 min. The analytical performances, including the calibration graph, linearity range, correlation coefficient, detection limit, reproducibility, and recovery tests, were evaluated under the optimized chromatographic conditions. Consequently, the usefulness of the present method for monitoring plant growth nutrients in practical liquid fertilizer samples was demonstrated for understanding not only the composition of the inorganic ionic nutrients, but also the composition of inorganic ionic nitrogen by applying the IEC/AEC. © 2019 The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry.

AB  - After the Tohoku Earthquake of 2011, converting biomass resources to electrical energy has become a major focus in Japan. The government encourages local governments to use biogas plants to recycle organic waste. This study evaluated the biogas and liquid compost plants managed by local governments using life cycle assessment（LCA）, and includes a comparative analysis of greenhouse gas（GHG）emis-sions with respect to the economic cost of each plant. For the LCA, the amount of GHG emissions was calculated by dividing the whole process implemented by these plants into three stages: carrying and transporting organic waste, plant operations, and transporting and spraying liquid fertilizer. The results showed that the plant operations stage accounted for the highest proportion of GHG emissions. Further-more, transporting and spraying liquid fertilizer had the lowest percentage of GHG emissions for both plant types. In terms of the carbon content of raw materials, the GHG emissions from the biogas plant were approximately 38% those of the liquid compost plant. In addition, the economic cost of the biogas plant was superior to the liquid compost plant. © 2019, Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phosphorus recovery and recycling can improve the sustainability of nutrient use in agriculture. In this study, p was recovered by reacting aluminum-based water treatment residuals (Al-WTr) with organic matter-rich, high p concentration (60-100 mg L-1) dairy wastewater. The resulting p-rich (500-700 mg kg-1 Olsen p, ~10 g kg-1 total p) Al/O-WTr was applied as fertilizer in screen houses using romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. longifolial) planted in Typic Haploxerolls with limited bioavailable p (&lt;10 mg kg-1). Two experiments were conducted in 10-L pots: (i) fertilizer comparison, with liquid fertilizer (N, p, k, and micronutrients), slow release fertilizer (N, p, k, and micronutrients), liquid fertilizer with no p (control), and liquid fertilizer with ~5 g Al/O-WTr per kg soil (~15 t Al/O-WTr ha-1); (ii) Al/O-WTr rate comparison (~0, 2, 3, 5, and 7 g kg soil-1, equivalent to 0, 6, 10, 15, and 22 t Al/O-WTr ha-1). In the fertilizer comparison, lettuce biomass was significantly greater in all treatments (&gt;140 g pot-1) compared to the control (57 g pot-1). In the rate comparison experiment, lettuce biomass was also significantly greater in the Al/O-WTr treatments (412 to 512 g pot-1) compared to the control (309 g pot-1). The highest additions of Al/O-WTr produced the highest lettuce yield. Lettuce yield and p concentration were similar across treatments, indicating that Al/O-WTr can provide sufficient p to perform similarly to common fertilizers. recovery and reuse of p using Al-WTr may therefore improve the sustainability of nutrient cycling in agriculture. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - In India seaweeds are not used extensively except for production of phyco-colloids, being a rich source of vitamins, minerals and growth promotors, they can be of immense help to the coastal farmers for their use as a source of organic fertilizer. The effect of seaweed liquid fertilizer on the growth and biochemical characteristics of Lablab purpureus L. Sweet, and Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L. Taub., were studied. The growth parameters such as seed germination percentage, root length, shoot length, seedling fresh weight and seedling dry weight were carried out. The biochemical characteristics like estimation of total chlorophyll, estimation of protein, estimation of total sugar and estimation of reducing sugar were also worked out. The results of growth parameters were gradually increased upto 25% of SLF treated seedlings when compared with control. Our results proved that the seaweed liquid fertilizer promote the growth of the seedlings due to the presence of micro, macro elements and growth hormones in the extract which is responsible for the enhancement of the growth of the pulses. © 2019 Plant Archives.

AB  - Concentrate is required to be added for forage feeding in order to meet nutritional needs and also to increase the productivity of goat livestock. This study was done gradually and continuously, starting from the making of liquid organic fertilizer with the addition of Morinda fruit bio-activator that used to cultivate Taiwan grass. Furthermore, the Taiwan grass is combined with concentrate to be given to goats every day at different treatment level. During the cultivation process, consumption and weight gain value are generated in goats. It can be concluded that the value of consumption and weight gain are not significant statistically. However, the best weight gain is obtained in K3 treatment with a value of 0.29 kg/day and it is also in line with the value of feed consumption in K3. Taiwan grass as initial feed and concentrate as additional feed in balancing level so that it can fulfill nutritional needs of goat livestock. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

AB  - Excessive use of inorganic fertilizers can aggravate soil conditions. The development of organic fertilizer is urgently required. The fertilizers are used to supply organic materials to improve the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil. Meanwhile, many potential waste from coconut porridge household industry in Ponorogo Distric of Indonesia have not been utilized properly yet. The aim of this research are to improve the quality of liquid organic fertilizers by using various microorganisms with addition of liquid materials such as coconut water waste, water of immersed coconut fiber and molasses; and to observe the growth of chilies, tomatoes, and eggplants which were treated using the organic fertilizer. Liquid organic fertilizer was made by mixing the liquid materials using various microorganisms, such as Aspergillus niger, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus muchilaginosis, Azotobacter chrococum and bioactivator EM4. The liquid fertilizer was carried out with a mixed batch reactor equipped of aeration 4 L/min for 10 days. From this research was conducted observations on the development of height and fruit on the assesed plants using the produced fertilizer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This study was conducted to elucidate the effects of fertilization level on the growth of Cryptomeria japonica container seedlings. In a basic fertilizer test, seedlings were grown under three fertilization conditions using the slow-release fertilizer A (N-P-K = 12-8-10) at 5-6, 10-12, or 20-24 g/L. Seedling height increased with increasing amounts of fertilizer added, although no differences were observed between the 10-12 and 20-24 g/L doses. In the additional fertilizer test, the effects on seedling growth were compared between three concentrations of slow-release fertilizers B (10-18-15) and C (6-9-9) at 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 g/seedling, and a liquid fertilizer. Additional treatment with 4.5 g of fertilizer B produced the greatest increase in seedling growth, particularly diameter. Seedlings were raised under optimal conditions of base fertilization treatment (20 g of fertilizer A, 40 g of leaf mold and 4 g of magnesium lime per 1 L of soil) and additional fertilization treatment (4.5 g of fertilizer B and 0.9 g of magnesium lime per plant); this treatment produced seedlings with an average size of 36.2 cm in height and 4.8 mm in diameter one year after sowing. From this experiment, the 69% of container seedlings grew up to reach the Japanese Forestry Agency's 5th standard size even within one growing period, although the period for bare-root seedlings needs two years in the Japanese Kanto region. Therefore, our results demonstrate a reduction of the growth period of Cryptomeria japonica through the efficient propagation of container seedlings supplemented with the application of slow-release fertilizers. © 2019 Nihon Ringakkai.

AB  - Three coleus (Plectranthus scutellarioides) cultivars were grown with one of five constant liquid fertilizer concentrations (75, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg L-1 N) using a 13N-0.86P-10.8K fertilizer. The cultivars used were ‘Broad Street’, ‘Stained Glassworks Eruption’, and ‘Wall Street’. Tissue samples were collected and analyzed for concentrations of nutrient concentrations at two different times. At each harvest date, plant height, plant diameter, and shoot dry weight were recorded. Each cultivar achieved maximum growth when grown with ≤300 mg L-1 N, while 400 mg L-1 N was detrimental. Foliar nutrient sufficiency ranges were determined based on fertilizer concentrations resulting in maximum growth for each cultivar. These results provide improved coleus fertilization recommendations and foliar sufficiency ranges. © 2019 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing number of biogas plants results in increasing digestate volume used as fertilizer on arable land. This study compared the influence of digestate addition on soil chemical properties with traditional organic fertilizers such as liquid and solid cattle manure and with mineral fertilizer. The digestate supplied soil with a significant amount of NH4-N, whose nitrification was slower comparing to soils treated with mineral fertilizer and liquid cattle manure. Digestate also slightly increased concentration of water-soluble phosphorus in soil and added high amounts of plant-available potassium and dissolved organic carbon. Therefore, the application of digestate should follow the same rules as traditional liquid fertilizers; however, its agronomic use should be based not only on N, but also on P and K content. © 2019 University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn.

AB  - A pot experiment was conducted to identify the potential of Sargassum wightii, Turbinaria ornata and Caulerpa racemosa on growth and biochemical parameters of Andrographis paniculata. Seaweed liquid extracts were given to the tested plant in form of foliar spray. After 60 days, growth parameters such as shoot length, root length, total plant height, leaf area, number of the leaves, fresh and dried weight and biochemical parameters such as starch, glucose, protein, chlorophyll content were observed in the treated plants. Foliar application of individual seaweed treatments (T1, T2, T3) enhanced the overall growth and physiology of Andrographis paniculata. But, there was an appreciable increase in growth and biochemical parameters in the treated plants which received mixture of seaweeds (T4) when compared to individual treatment and control. This might may be due to synergistic and cumulative effect of qualitative and quantitative active ingredients such as micro and macroelements, vitamins and phytohormones present in the seaweed liquid extracts. Thus, seaweed liquid extract could serve as an promising effective organic biostumulant to replace the synthetic fertilizers for sustainable agriculture. © 2019 Plant Archives. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: The objective of this research was to study the effect of bio-liquid organic fertilizer on the growth of Dipterocarpus alatus Roxb seedlings (30 days old) in the pot experiment. Methodology and results: For the production of bio-liquid fertilizers, distillery slop; molasses and bio-methane waste water were fermented with plant growth promoting bacteria, which had potentials for nitrogen fixing, phosphate solubilizing and potassium solubilizing properties. It was found that treatment no. 13 (molasses + three bacterial isolates (PGPB), 30 days of fermentation) presented the best result on the growth parameters of D. alatus Roxb including root length (21.67 cm), shoot height (20.33 cm), root fresh weight (1.49 g), shoot fresh weight (3.61 g) and total biomass (4.13 g). Moreover, using liquid organic fertilizer produced from molasses supplemented with bacteria had higher growth-promoting effects on D. alatus than the effective microorganisms (EM). Conclusion, significance and impact of study: To covert agricultural residues to the valuable product was the aim of this work. In our experiment, we found that molasses and bio-methane waste water were suitable for using as a material to produce liquid organic fertilizers which were beneficial for promoting growth of D. alatus seedlings. © 2019 Universiti Sains Malaysia.

AB  - There is a growing body of research that recognizes the potentials of biochar application in agricultural production systems. However, little is known about the effects of biochar, especially hydrochar, on production of containerized seedlings under nursery conditions. This study aimed to test the effects of hydrochar application on growth, quality, nutrient and heavy metal contents, and mycorrhizal association of containerized pine seedlings. The hydrochar used in this study was produced through hydrothermal carbonization of paper mill biosludge at 200 ◦C. Two forms of hydrochar (powder and pellet) were mixed with peat at ratios of 10% and 20% (v/v) under three levels of applied commercial fertilizer (nil, half and full rates). Application of hydrochar had positive or neutral effects on shoot biomass and stem diameter compared with control seedlings (without hydrochar) under tested fertilizer levels. Analysis of the natural logarithmic response ratios (LnRR) of quality index and nutrient and heavy metal uptake revealed that application of 20% (v/v) hydrochar powder or pellet with 50% fertilizer resulted in same quality pine seedlings with similar heavy metal (Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn and Cr) and nutrient (P, K, Ca and Mg) contents as untreated seedlings supplied with 100% fertilizer. Colonization percentage by ectomycorrhizae significantly increased when either forms of hydrochar were applied at a rate of 20% under unfertilized condition. The results of this study implied that application of proper rates of hydrochar from biosludge with adjusted levels of liquid fertilizer may reduce fertilizer requirements in pine nurseries. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In the present work, Scenedesmus sp. was grown under a semicontinuous regime in fertilizer (Bayfolan® Forte, 1 mL L−1) medium, and Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM) as control, in raceways of 200 and 2000 L under greenhouse conditions. The biomass, lipid, protein, carbohydrate and total pigment production was determined. The culture under the semicontinuous regime allowed an increase in the productivities in each consecutive cycle, reaching a lipid productivity of 20.00 ± 6.29 mg L−1 d−1 in Bayfolan medium. The biomass productivity in the medium supplemented with fertilizer was significantly higher than in the BBM. The protein productivity was significantly higher in Bayfolan (1.93 ± 0.28 L−1 d−1). The average carbohydrate productivity of the cycles was 10.10 ± 2.01 mg L−1 d−1. The fertilizer allowed an increase of up to 3-fold in total pigment productivity compared to the BBM. The fatty acids obtained were mainly composed of C16:0, C18:3n3 (α-linolenic) and C18:0. Palmitic acid (C16:0) was the main fatty acids methyl ester accumulated along with stearic (C18:0) and myristic (C14:0) acids. It was shown that the utilization of the liquid fertilizer Bayfolan is a potential alternative to replace conventional media. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The application of stimulants to improve growth rate and quality of crops is gaining importance. Such preparations do not harm the environment and may partly supplement the action of nutrients applied. Therefore, during 2012-2014, a study was conducted to evaluate the performance of several stimulants: an amino acid preparation, liquid fertilizer biostimulant, seaweed extract, a multiple natural foliar nanofertilizer and their combinations on wheat grain yield and quality. The results indicated that these preparations strongly influenced grain yield and baking traits such as falling number, protein content, wet gluten, sedimentation value and bread volume. The best results were obtained on using multiple natural foliar nanofertilizer + amino acid preparation, with 20.1% higher yield in 2013 and 22.6% higher yield in 2014 in comparison with the control. The most favourable values of technological features were obtained with multiple natural foliar nanofertilizer in combination with amino acid preparation or seaweed extract. Wet gluten was the highest and the protein content and bread volume were high after spraying wheat with multiple natural foliar nanofertilizer and the next values of protein content and sedimentation resulted from the use of seaweed extract. The interest in nanofertilizers and preparations that stimulate plant growth and development is increasing constantly and it may become one of the essential elements of cultivation technology in future. Broadening the knowledge on bioregulators can result in an increase in the effectiveness of agricultural production as well as in the quality of crops. © 2019 Current Science Association, Bengaluru.

AB  - Compost leachate (CL) is a liquid by-product of compost that contains carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and trace elements. It can partially replace the commercial liquid fertilisers to promote plant growth. However, CL may contain heavy metals, phytotoxic substances such as ammonia, organic compounds of low molecular weight, high level of salt and oils. Treatment of leachate is required to avoid the damage on the plant. This paper aims to review the nutrient and physical characteristics of the CL from three types of bio-wastes, i.e. municipal solid waste, animal waste and green waste. The effects of plants treated with CL in terms of rate and nutrient absorption were discussed. The nutrient and physical composition of the leachate is highly variable due to the diversity of the sources and age of the leachate. Compost leachate from municipal solid waste contains the highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) (15,188 – 105,300 mg/L) followed by those from animal waste (6,542 – 100,000 mg/L) and green waste (804 – 1,152 mg/L). The difference in COD is due to the difference in organic carbon content in the biowaste. Other physical parameters, such as electrical conductivity and pH, are correlated with the organic carbon content. For nutrient composition, municipal solid waste leachate contains the highest nitrogen content (630 – 2,438 mg/L), green waste has the highest potassium content (500 – 1,000 mg/L), while animal waste has the highest phosphate content (170 – 500 mg/L). The nutrient contents of CL derived from different biowaste reviewed in this study serves as a guideline for users to estimate the dilution rate and further nutrient formulation required for the application of CL on plants.

AB  - Today, an important problem is the conversion of organic wastes into vermicompost and alternative organic fertilizer is obtained which is beneficial to sustain the productivity of the soil. Vermicompost is fertilizer material rich in symbiotic, asymbiotic microorganisms, mycorrhizal fungi and actinomycetes, as well as worm secretions, growth hormones, enzymes, vitamins and amino acids. Vermicompost increases the population of beneficial organism in the soil by using these beneficial properties in plant growth and suppresses diseases and harmful effects and provides positive changes in physical, chemical and biological parameters of soil and provides significant improvements in plant growth and yield and nutrient uptake. This study was conducted in order to examine the effects of solid and liquid earthworm fertilizer dosages on nutrients uptaking of Narcissus cv. 'Royal Connection' plant in the Siirt University in 2016-2017 in the ecological conditions of Siirt province.

AB  - Greenery the boon of nature to planet Earth is such a benefaction we humans have been enjoining for ages together. A garden is incomplete without a gardener who extended his patient-labor and care towards it, but in this augmenting world it is really difficult to extend attention and care to plants which are an inevitable part of our lives and are of aesthetic value and contain medicinal and commercial importance. Henceforth to overcome this there are a sundry of options but the best and the most feasible one is through the powerful tool of today’s world that is IOT(Internet of Things). The proposed model will monitor and care your plant and will also intimate you so that necessary actions can be taken and can also be used for research purposes to study the behavior of plants with respect to various other parameters which affects its growth and development. The purpose of this proposed model is to monitor various parameters affecting the growth and survival of a plant and to take necessary action for its wellbeing. It will be collecting data in accordance to parameters like soil humidity, light index, Air quality index, temperature and the amount of water consumed by the plant using Intel Edison and IOT platform Thing speak. It will automatically water the plant when the soil humidity goes down and can also provide it with liquid fertilizer’s or with pesticides and gives an indication while watering and will timely update the above parameters to the server wherein we can make use of it either for domestic caring or for research or commercial purpose which can be monitored from any part of the world. © Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

AB  - To explore the effects of biogas slurry coordinating chemical fertilizer on growth promotion of tomato, we used three kinds of typical biogas slurry as concentrated nutrient solution, respectively fermented from raw duck manure, pig manure, cow dung, while urea, monocalcium phosphate and potassium sulphate as auxiliary nutrition to balance the nutrient difference between different dilution ratios of biogas slurry. The results showed the biogas slurry partially substituting chemical fertilizer could significantly improve soil fertility, including available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. As for water soluble calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese and zinc in soil, biogas slurry application could activate their availability, with the magnitude of such effects depended on the fermentation level of raw materials and dilution ratio. Compared with chemical fertilizer, coordinating biogas liquid fertilizer significantly promoted the growth of tomato, with the yield increased by 55.9%-232.8% and the chemical fertilizer dosage decreased by 18.2%-85.0%. Furthermore, such effects became more prominent along with prolonged time. The fruit quality was significantly improved with the increases of lycopene, ascorbic acid and total sugar, and the decreases of acidity and nitrite concentration, and the decrease of NO2- by 35.6%-90.3%. In addition, the taste flavor of fruits was 7.0%-20.3% higher than that of chemical fertilizer treatment. The yield and quality of tomato took on nonlinear synchronization, and the relation between taste flavor and sugar/acid showed significantly positive correlation, which was affected by fertilizer type. Biogas slurry partly substituting chemical fertilizer could achieve the goals of high yield, high quality, environmental protection, efficient utilization of agricultural resources in tomato production. © 2019, Science Press.

AB  - Coral bells (Heuchera sp.) are popular herbaceous perennials grown for their colorful foliage and venation and their aesthetic appeal in mixed containers and landscapes. Commercial coral bell production requires greenhouse or nursery growers to optimize production inputs such as managing mineral nutrition, thereby maximizing plant growth potential and foliage color. The objective of this study was to determine the optimum fertilizer concentrations, identify leaf tissue nutrient sufficiency ranges by chronological age, and to expand leaf tissue nutrient standards of coral bells grown in soilless substrates during container production. Coral bells (H. hybrida ‘Black Beauty’, ‘Cherry Cola’, ‘Marmalade’, and ‘Peppermint Spice’), varying in leaf color, were grown under one of six constant liquid fertilizer concentrations [50, 75, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg·L-1 nitrogen (N)] with a constant level of water-soluble micronutrient blend in a greenhouse. Fertilizer concentrations for optimal plant growth and development were determined by analyzing plant height, diameter, growth index, and total dry mass, and were found to be 50 to 75 mg·L-1 N after a nine-week crop cycle. Recently mature leaf tissue samples were collected and analyzed for elemental content of 11 nutrients at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after transplant (WAT) from plants fertilized with 50 to 75 mg·L-1 N. The black- (‘Black Beauty’) and red- (‘Cherry Cola’) colored-leaved cultivars contained higher total N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), zinc (Zn), and boron (B) than the orange- (‘Marmalade’) and green-(‘Peppermint Spice’) colored-leaved cultivars. For instance, in mature growth, total N concentration for ‘Black Beauty’ and ‘Cherry Cola’ ranged between 3.45 to 3.63% and 3.92% to 4.18% N, respectively, whereas for ‘Marmalade’ and ‘Peppermint Spice’, ranges were between 2.98% to 3.25% and 2.78% to 3.23% N, respectively. Optimal leaf tissue concentration sufficiency ranges determined in this scientifically based study were narrower and often times higher than previously reported survey values for coral bells. © 2019 American Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - The production of tobacco Virginia in Argentina is located at Jujuy and Salta where crop irrigation is mainly done by a gravity system. The possibility of using precision irrigation methods and the low sensitivity of the crop to moderate water stress allow assuming that it is feasible to irrigate tobacco with a deficit strategy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of high frequency deficit irrigation during the period that precede summer precipitation at the Valle de Lerma (Cerrillos, Salta) on tobacco leaf dry matter and its main component for two transplant dates. Attributes related to water and radiation use efficiencies were also determined. The study was conducted during three growing cycles (2013/14, 2015/16 y 2016/17) at INTA EEA-Salta with the tobacco Virginia variety K394. Treatments consisted of the combination of two transplant dates (early, Te; late, Ta) and two level of irrigation requirement (NR): 100 and 50% of NR. Leaf dry matter (MSh), total dry matter (leaf+stem), leaf area index (IAF) and specific foliar mass (MFE) were determined at different moments. Phyllochron, crop accumulated intercepted radiation (Rint) and radiation use efficiency (EUR) were determined in 2015/16 and 2016/17. Water use efficiency was calculated for the 20-24 leaf and harvest samplings considering the irrigation water (EUAr) and the water contributed by the rainfall and irrigation (EUApr). MSh at harvest was lower in 2013/14 than in the other growing cycles, but was similar for the two transplant dates in each growing cycle. Although Te received more incident radiation (300-400 MJ) than Ta, this only represented an extra 3% of Rint during the growing cycle. Therefore, the lowest MSh in 2013/14 was explained by the lowest IAF. IAF and MFE were similar between transplant dates in 2013/14 and 2016/17, whereas for the 2015/16 growing cycle the lower IAF at harvest found for Te generated leaves with higher MFE. There were not differences between transplant date for EUR at harvest, ranging from 0,46 to 0,48 g/MJ. Replacement of 50% of NR did not penalize MSh and IAF during the 2015/16 and 2016/17 growing cycles (when the fertilized used was liquid), whereas it decreased MSh and IAF in 2013/14 (when liquid fertilizer was used). EUApr was lower in 2013/14 than in the other growing cycles. EUApr was always higher for Ta than Te, and for 50% of NR only in 2015/16. During the three growing cycles the lowest EUAr was found with the combination of Ta and 50% of NR. The controlled deficit irrigation is an alternative for tobacco production in Valle de Lerma; however, studies considering leaf quality should be considering. © 2019 Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria.

AB  - Fermented Plant Extract (FPE) from the ngapi nut peel (Pithecellobium jiringa Prain) was produced as organic liquid fertilizer and pesticide to replace consumption of inorganic fertilizers and plant resistance for pests. FPE was fermented from the composition 250 g ngapi nut : 40 mL Effective Microorganism-4 (EM-4) : 40 mL brown sugar 1kg/L : 920 mL distilled water for 15 days, it contained Nitrogen 0.98%, Phosphor 0.05%, Potassium 0.62%, C.org 12.90%, phenolic content 414.1 mg/L and pH 3. The FPE was applied to planted tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill) and showed the best growth and plant resistance for pests. Macronutrient N, P, K, organic carbon in soil that treated and non-treated by FPE after 30 days were analyzed by Kjehdahl, Spectrophotometry and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) method. FPE treatment could increase the amount of macronutrient in soil compared to the non-treated soil (control). Similarly, the nutrient (N, P, K) uptake by tomato with FPE treatment was higher than that with non-treated FPE. The nutrient uptake by tomato were nitrogen 2.62%; phosphorus 74.71%; potassium 42.44%; and non-treated with nitrogen 0.60%; phosphorus 27.07%; potassium 11.72%. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Poor sanitation due to improper treatment of human excreta, and energy scarcity are global problems with only partial solutions. Thus, feasible conversion of human excreta into safe, reusable “products” and renewable energy could be advantageous. The research objectives were to study the properties and major chemical processes occurring during hydrothermal carbonization of raw human excreta with typical solids content, as well as exploring potential use of the resulting hydrochar and aqueous phase. Human excreta (often considered as black water) were hydrothermally carbonized in a set of nine 50-mL laboratory batch reactors under a range of severities, a single parameter obtained from a coalification model that represents the combination of temperature and time. Three temperatures (180, 210 and 240 °C) and reaction times (30, 60 and 120 min) were used. The physicochemical characteristics such as yield, elemental composition, organic matter and calorific value of the hydrochar (solid phase) were studied. Aqueous phase was characterized for carbon, nitrogen, macro and micronutrients composition. In addition, the potential use of the hydrochar and aqueous phase were studied. There was high correlation between severity factor and carbon content (R2 = 0.95) and calorific value (R2 = 0.89). Hydrochar yield decreased with increasing severity from 69 to 56%. Calorific values increased from 24.7 to 27.6 MJ/kg, falling within the calorific range of sub-bituminous coal. The aqueous phase demonstrated high nitrogen concentration, reaching up to 8178 mg/L total nitrogen, while N:P:K ratios were similar to those of commercial fertilizers. Pilot scale experiments resembled the results found in laboratory scale experiments for both hydrochar and aqueous phase and fitted the regression curves obtained from the severity factor. It is postulated that hydrothermal carbonization of human excreta could potentially serve as a sustainable sanitation technology with a closed-loop cycle approach while recovering energy and nutrients. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the worsening energy problems, seeking renewable energy has become the key factor in the modern society. Hydrothermal biorefinery of turning spent agricultural biomass into value-added bio-nutrient solution has become a rising trend. Hydrothermal biorefinery of spent agricultural biomass into value-added bio-nutrient solution applied in agricultural sustainable development has development potential. In this study, Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC) was used as the starting material for silicon-containing agricultural biomass (sugarcane exocarp). At high temperature (200 ± 10 ℃) and high pressure (15 atm), cellulose was introduced into a bio-nutrient solution to create added value. This experiment was carried out in both the field and the greenhouse. This study found that the bio-nutrient solution containing amino acid oligosaccharide as the main fertilizer can be used directly in leaf fertilization and can achieve effective root fertilization. A bio-nutrient solution containing 17.85% humic acid (umic acid > 10%, can be identified as humic acid liquid fertilizer), a liquid organic soil improver, and can promote crop growth. Field crop stem lengths increased up to 40% with fresh crop weights increasing 113% or more. Web chamber stem lengths increased by 117% and crop weights increased 115% or more; field crop stem length increased by about 23% compared to the net crop stem length. The fresh weight of greenhouse-produced crops was about 2% higher than that of field- grown crops. Sprayed bio-nutrient solution increased crop production by about 3.8%, as compared to crops that were not sprayed with bio-nutrient solution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this research a hybrid thermochemical and biochemical approach is proposed to produce biocarbon, biomethane and biofertilizer from corn residue using the concept of resource recovery from biowaste. In this approach, corn residue is first pretreated in hydrothermal carbonization process to produce solid biocarbon. Hydrothermal process water, a co-product of hydrothermal carbonization process underwent fast anaerobic digestion to produce biomethane and biofertilizer. Effects of operating conditions (process temperature and residence time) on both biocarbon and hydrothermal process water contents were studied. Four selected hydrothermal temperatures of 200 °C, 220 °C, 240 °C and 260 °C and their three corresponding residence times of 10 min, 20 min and 30 min were considered. Among these 12 hydrothermal processes, 240 °C for 30 min process produced hybrid bioenergy of 14.26 MJkg−1 of raw corn residue with an overall energy yield of 78.65%. Biocarbon produced at 240 °C for 30 min and 260 °C for 10–30 min were comparable to pulverized coal used in power plants, which contained high heating values of 23.01 MJkg−1 to 24.70 MJkg−1. All anaerobic digestion digestate are nutrient enriched and useable as liquid fertilizer. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aims of this study were to analyze the influence of farmers' characteristics on cattle waste processing, and also what is the strongest indicator to reflect the variables of farmer's characteristic and cattle waste processing. Structured questionnaires were used to obtain information from 112 respondents consisting of two persons as group's representatives of Simantri members from 2014-2015. The groups of Simantri selected by purposive sampling method. Data obtained were analyzed by a descriptive method and statistic analysis. Results indicated that the farmer's characteristics proved to have a positive and significant effect on cattle waste processing. The skill of Simantri is the strongest indicator to reflect the variable of farmers characteristic because it has the highest value of weight measurement (0.898). Biogas is the strongest indicator to reflecting the cattle waste processing with the weight measurement value of 0.987. The skills of respondents to the processing of cattle waste into solid and liquid fertilizer is closely related to the frequent training, the addition of knowledge and experience in the cattle waste processing. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Several treatment technologies are available for the treatment of palm oil mill wastes. Vermicomposting is widely recognized as efficient, eco-friendly methods for converting organic waste materials to valuable products. This study evaluates the effect of different vermicompost extracts obtained from palm oil mill effluent (POME) and palm-pressed fiber (PPF) mixtures on the germination, growth, relative toxicity, and photosynthetic pigments of mung beans (Vigna radiata) plant. POME contains valuable nutrients and can be used as a liquid fertilizer for fertigation. Mung bean seeds were sown in petri dishes irrigated with different dilutions of vermicomposted POME-PPF extracts, namely 50, 60, and 70% at varying dilutions. Results showed that at lower dilutions, the vermicompost extracts showed favorable effects on seed germination, seedling growth, and total chlorophyll content in mung bean seedlings, but at higher dilutions, they showed inhibitory effects. The carotenoid contents also decreased with increased dilutions of POME-PPF. This study recommends that the extracts could serve as a good source of fertilizer for the germination and growth enhancement of mung bean seedlings at the recommended dilutions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Automatic transplanters can improve the transplanting efficiency of vegetable seedling plugs, which are widely applied and valued in production. However, the transplantation of automatic transplanters is limited by pick-up failure or root lump destruction. To get plug seedling quality suitable for mechanical transplantation, orthogonal experiments targeting at cucumber plug seedlings and involving factors of substrate composition (ratios of sphagnum peat moss to perlite and vermiculite volume were 2:1:1, 3:1:1 and 4:1:1), substrate compaction (ratios of substrate to pore volume were 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4) and liquid fertilizer concentration (EC values were 1.0 mS/cm, 1.2 mS/cm and 1.4 mS/cm) were conducted. The cucumber plug seedlings were compressed or drawn by using a texture analyzer to test the compressive resistance and plug abscission force. The stem thickness, plant height, dry root weight and dry stem weight were measured, and the growing quality was evaluated using a sound seedling index. Root lumps were scanned by an X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). Roots were isolated from root lumps by using a threshold segmentation method and three-dimensionally reconstructed. The roots were divided into five equal parts vertically and six equal parts horizontally; the ratio of root volume in each part to the volume of root lump in this zone was defined as the root density. Then the root volume and density were statistically analyzed. It was found that the compressive resistance and plug abscission force were both significantly affected by the substrate composition and substrate compaction. Both compressive resistance and plug abscission force were improved with the rise of sphagnum peat moss concentration or compaction degree. The sound seedling index was firstly increased and then decreased with the rising concentration of sphagnum peat moss in the substrate, compaction and fertilization concentration. Vertically, the ratio of minimum to maximum root distribution densities was defined as the root uniformity degree, which was used to evaluate the root uniformity. Horizontally, the peripheral root distribution density was used to evaluate the lump enveloped degree. Clearly, substrate composition, compaction and fertilization concentration all significantly affected the root uniformity coefficient and root enveloping coefficient. Multi-object optimization of compressive resistance, plug abscission force, sound seedling index, root uniformity and peripheral root distribution density were conducted via a comprehensive scoring method, which identified the optimal three-factor combination were substrate composition of 3:1:1, substrate compaction of 1.2 and liquid fertilizer EC value of 1.2 mS/cm. Experiments on automatic pick-up transplanter showed at the frequency of clamping seedlings were 43 plants/min, 48 plants/min and 53 plants/min, the root lump destruction rates were 3.6%, 3.9% and 4.3%, respectively, the pick-up success rates were 97.2%, 96.1% and 94.8%, respectively, which were better than other factor combinations and consistent with the comprehensive scoring result. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - Nutrient optimization has been proposed as a way to increase boreal forest production, and involves chronic additions of liquid fertilizer with amounts of micro- and macro-nutrients adjusted annually to match tree nutritional requirements. We used a short-term (maintained since 2007) and a long-term (maintained since 1987) fertilization experiment in northern Sweden, in order to understand nutrient optimization effects on soil microbiota and mesofauna, and to explore the relationships between plant litter and microbial elemental stoichiometry. Soil microbes, soil fauna, and aboveground litter were collected from the control plots, and short- and long-term nutrient optimization plots. Correlation analyses revealed no relationships between microbial biomass and litter nutrient ratios. Litter C:N, C:P and N:P ratios declined in response to both optimization treatments; while only microbial C:P ratios declined in response to long-term nutrient optimization. Further, we found that both short- and long-term optimization treatments decreased total microbial, fungal, and bacterial PLFA biomass and shifted the microbial community structure towards a lower fungi:bacterial ratio. In contrast, abundances of most fungal- and bacterial-feeding soil biota were little affected by the nutrient optimization treatments. However, abundance of hemi-edaphic Collembola declined in response to the long-term nutrient optimization treatment. The relative abundances (%) of fungal-feeding and plant-feeding nematodes, respectively, declined and increased in response to both short-term and long-term treatments; bacterial-feeding nematodes increased relative to fungal feeders. Overall, our results demonstrate that long-term nutrient optimization aiming to increase forest production decreases litter C:N, C:P and N:P ratios, microbial C:P ratios and fungal biomass, whereas higher trophic levels are less affected. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Government of Ethiopia recently introduced a new synthetic compound fertilizer (NPS; 19% N, 38% P2O5, and 7% S) for blending with K, Zn, and B. The performance of NPS, and whether blending it with organic liquid fertilizer (OLF), improves growth and productivity of onion (Allium cepa L.) has not been studied. The experiment was conducted in the Gurage zone, Ethiopia, from June to September 2016 to identify the best combination of NPS and OLF to increase onion productivity. Combinations of NPS and OLF used were 0, 400, or 500 L∙ha−1 OLF and 0, 150, or 200 kg∙ha−1 of NPS. The interaction of NPS and OLF affected plant height, leaf number, bulb diameter, and bulb dry weight with the highest mean values (43.6 cm, 7.73/plant, 5.14 cm, and 20.8 g/bulb) obtained from 400 L∙ha−1 OLF+0 NPS, 0 OLF+200 kg∙ha−1 NPS, 400 L∙ha−1 OLF+0 NPS, and 400 L∙ha−1 OLF+200 kg∙ha−1 NPS, respectively. The main effect of OLF affected onion leaf length, total bulb yield, and bulb fresh weight with the highest values obtained from 400, 500, and 500 L∙ha−1 OLF were 36.5 cm, 46.2 t∙ha−1, and 46.8 g/bulb, respectively. The main effect of NPS affected total bulb yield, with the highest yield, 46.1 kg∙ha−1, obtained from 200 kg∙ha−1 NPS. Growth and yield attributes were influenced differently by OLF and NPS fertilizers, indicating that there is an opportunity to customize combinations of OLF and NPS to increase productivity of red onion. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The major sources of nutrients to organic grown apple trees are fertilizers made from manure, compost, bone meal, etc. Depending on humidity and temperature in soil and air, the nutrients are dissolved or mineralized and made available to the trees during the growing season. In conventional apple growing, the trees are given mineral fertilizers in early spring to improve the nitrogen status in the trees during flowering for better fruit set. Is it possible in an organic production system to increase the plant available nitrogen in the flowering period by application of liquid N-fertilizers? The standard fertilizer in Norwegian organic fruit growing is dried and pelleted chicken manure with bone meal and vinasse (Marihøne plus; NPK 8-4-5). In these experiments, a liquid fertilizer (Pioner Hi-fruit; NPK 4-1-5) based on vegetable matter plus potassium-vinasse was compared to the standard fertilizer. The liquid fertilizer was applied to the soil as fertigation from 2 weeks before the estimated start of flowering. The dry product was applied 2 weeks prior to flowering. To incorporate the fertilizers into the soil, a mechanical hoer (Orizzonti, Italy) was run in all plots after the application of dry fertilizer. The nitrogen and mineral contents in soil, leaves and fruit were analyzed. The liquid fertilization applied on the soil in the spring gave higher N-contents in soil and trees compared to the dried manure product. However, the increase in N-content was not very strong in the leaf samples. Apples from trees given high doses of liquid fertilizers were greener with less cover colour and higher IAD-indexes. Still they were softer and had less starch than fruit from other treatments. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - An agronomic study conducted on lettuce demonstrated that a simplified floating system could provide a suitable produce for domestic use. Either single salts or ready-to-use liquid fertilizers were used to prepare the nutrient solution and no difference in lettuce yield and quality was observed between the two solutions with the exception of nitrate content, which was higher when single salts were used. Considering the agronomic results, and criteria of aesthetics, limited weight and obstruction, manageability, modularity, novelty in materials, communication, and low cost, a small-scale floating system was then designed and an item not only functional, but also provided with aesthetic value, was developed. © ISHS.

AB  - Application of liquid fertilizers can significantly improve the fertilizer utilization efficiency and labor efficiency. Phase equilibrium of various fertilizers in aqueous solution is the basis of manufacturing liquid fertilizers. The solid-liquid phase equilibria of ternary systems NH4H2PO4 + CO(NH2)2 + H2O, (NH4)2HPO4 + CO(NH2)2 + H2O, K2SO4 + CO(NH2)2 + H2O, K2SO4 + NH4H2PO4 + H2O and K2SO4 + (NH4)2HPO4 + H2O at 303.2 K were investigated by isothermal solution saturation method. The maximum nutrient content of (NH4)2HPO4 + CO(NH2)2 + H2O solution is 31.78 wt% at the saturated solution of (NH4)2HPO4, and the mass ratio of N: P2O5 is 1: 2.53. In the solutions of NH4H2PO4 + CO(NH2)2 + H2O, K2SO4 + CO(NH2)2 + H2O and K2SO4 + (NH4)2HPO4 + H2O, the corresponding maximum of nutrient contents all are obtained at the corresponding invariant points as 33.82 wt%, 27.32 wt% and 32.92 wt% respectively. And the mass ratios of nutrients are N: P2O5 of 2.69: 1, K2O: N of 1:15.66 and N: P2O5: K2O of 1.64: 4.15: 1, respectively. The maximal nutrient content in the K2SO4 + NH4H2PO4 + H2O saturation solution is 25.14 wt% and the corresponding mass ratio of N: P2O5: K2O is 1.26: 6.38: 1. Based on the phase equilibrium diagrams, the species and nutrient contents in liquid fertilizers all are adjustable by choosing different raw materials or modulating the prescription. The results provide fundamental data for the preparation of liquid fertilizers. It is also helpful to optimize the operation parameters in the manufacturing process, storage process or application process to avoid the precipitation of solid. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aquaponics is one of the food production systems that combined recirculating aquaculture system and hydroponic system by the utilization of waste material excreted from fish as a liquid fertilizer for valued hydroponic vegetables and seaweeds. The plant factory using artificial light has the potentials of stable production and ensuring safety by closed environment and its control. The production method based on the material flow between the different production systems is vitally important for success of the productions. In this section, water management and control of material flow for production in aquaponics were explained and newly aquaponics productions with saline water and artificial light were introduced. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Autoclaving of food wastes (FW) for the resource recovery and reutilization was studied using the pilot plant scale. Experiments were conducted at various temperatures of 408, 428, and 438 K and times of 15 and 60 min. The in-filled steam to the autoclave was supplied by the incineration plant with a gauge pressure of 7 kg/cm2 and a temperature of 443 K or above. The results obtained from the experiments show that the less energy- and time-consuming autoclaving conditions (408 K and 15 min, denoted as Case A408-15) are effective. Comparisons of the properties and characteristics of autoclaved FW (FWA) of Case A408-15 with those of FW are made. The wet bulk volume and wet bulk density of FWA are dramatically reduced to 15.64% and increased to 313.37% relative to those of FW, respectively. This makes the subsequent processing and reuse for FWA more convenient than FW. The autoclaving results in an increase of carbon content and a decrease of nitrogen content, and thus an increase of the C/N ratio of FWA. The contents of sulfur, hemi-cellulose, and cellulose of FWA are also reduced. All these fluctuations are beneficial for making compost or other usages from FWA than FW. The autoclaved liquid product (LA) separated from FWA and liquid condensate (LC) from the released gas possess high COD and TOC. These two liquids can be mixed for use as liquid fertilizers with proper conditioning. Alternatively, further anaerobic digestion of the mixture of FWA, LA, and LC can offer enhanced biogas production for power generation. All these thus match the appeal of sustainable materials management and circular economy. The emitted gas from autoclaving contains no CO and some hydrocarbons. Suitable air pollution control is needed. The results and information obtained are useful for the proper recovery and reuse of abundant food wastes from domestic households and food industries. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - An olive waste stream mixture, coming from a three phase-continuous centrifugation olive oil mill industry, with a typical wet basis mass composition of olive pulp 39 wt%, kernels 5 wt% and olive mill waste water 56 wt%, was subjected to hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) at 180, 220 and 250 °C for a 3-hour residence time in a 2-litre stainless steel electrically heated batch reactor. The raw feedstock and corresponding hydrochars were characterised in terms of proximate and ultimate analyses, higher heating values and energy properties. Results showed an increase in carbonisation of samples with increasing HTC severity and an energy densification ratio up to 142% (at 250 °C). Hydrochar obtained at 250 °C was successfully pelletised using a lab scale pelletiser without binders or expensive drying procedures. Energy characterisation (HHV, TGA), ATR-FTIR analysis, fouling index evaluation and pelletisation results suggested that olive mill waste hydrochars could be used as energy dense and mechanical stable bio-fuels. Characterisation of HTC residues in terms of mineral content via induced coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) as well as Total and Dissolved Organic Carbon enabled to evaluate their potential use as soil improvers. Nutrients and polyphenolic compounds in HTC liquid fractions were evaluated for the estimation of their potential use as liquid fertilisers. Results showed that HTC could represent a viable route for the valorisation of olive mill industry waste streams. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Organic greenhouse (OGH) production is characterized by different systems and agricultural practices with diverse environmental impact. Soil arthropods are widely used as bioindicators of ecological sustainability in open field studies, while there is a lack of research on organic production for protected systems. This study assessed the soil arthropod abundance and diversity over a 2-year crop rotation in three systems of OGH production in the Mediterranean. The systems under assessment differed in soil fertility management: SUBST - a simplified system of organic production, based on an input substitution approach (use of guano and organic liquid fertilizers), AGROCOM - soil fertility mainly based on compost application and agroecological services crops (ASC) cultivation (tailored use of cover crops) as part of crop rotation, and AGROMAN - animal manure and ASC cultivation as part of crop rotation. Monitoring of soil fauna was performed by using pitfall traps and seven taxa were considered: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Araneae, Opiliones, Isopoda, Myriapoda, and Collembola. Results demonstrated high potential of ASC cultivation as a technique for beneficial soil arthropod conservation in OGH conditions. SUBST system was dominated by Collembola in all crops, while AGROMAN and AGROCOM had more balanced relative abundance of Isopoda, Staphylinidae, and Aranea. Opiliones and Myriapoda were more affected by season, while Carabidae were poorly represented in the whole monitoring period. Despite the fact that all three production systems are in accordance with the European Union regulation on organic farming, findings of this study displayed significant differences among them and confirmed the suitability of soil arthropods as bioindicators in protected systems of organic farming.

AB  - This research was conducted to create a plant-available nitrogen nutrient solution utilizing ruminant bacteria for ultimate use as a liquid nitrogen fertilizer for precision fertigation of vegetable crops. Three hyperammonia-producing ruminant bacteria, Clostridium aminophilum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sticklandii, were cultured anaerobically using five different organic nitrogen substrates to determine their efficiency in producing bioammonium/ammonia (BAA), a term defined here as a biologically produced solution containing both ammonium and ammonia. These bacteria were chosen because of their ability to produce ammonium at rates not experienced by any other bacteria. The five substrates were soy protein isolate (SPI), blood meal, feather meal, dried fish, and yeast extract (Y) used alone and in combination with Y. C. aminophilum and SPI were selected for further experimentation in an attempt to maximize BAA production. These substrates were chosen because they are commonly fed to cattle and they are also used as organic fertilizer amendments. C. aminophilum was cultured with SPI rates from 0.8 g·10 mL-1 salt solution reaching SPI's maximum solubility level at 1.6 g·10 mL-1 salt solution at 0.2 g intervals, and the BAA content was measured every 24 h for 168 h. It was concluded that there was no significant benefit in culturing C. aminophilum with more than 1.0 g·10 mL-1 for more than 96 h to achieve maximum BAA concentrations. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) reacts differently to foliar application of sulfur (S) and boron (B), and for that reason it is important to find an early indicator that would inform about the direction of this reaction. This study aimed at evaluating the early response of two double-low cultivars of winter oilseed rape: hybrid (Nelson) and open pollinated (Digger) on the foliar fertilization with S and B in two terms: fall and spring, based on the rate of leaf greenness index (SPAD) and seven indicators of chlorophyll a fluorescence (FL). On 7th or 9th day after the application of liquid fertilizers, the selected parameters of FL and SPAD were determined on the leaves of rape. As a result, a significant effect of foliar B and S supplementation on the yield of oilseed rape was found. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed for a separation for each of the cultivars the two parameters of FL, namely Tfm and Fv/F0, which are sensitive indicators of a physiological state of the rape plants shortly after foliar S and B dressing. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Pig slurry is classified as a natural liquid fertilizer, which is a heterogeneous mixture of urine, faeces, remnants of feed and technological water, used to remove excrement and maintain the hygiene of livestock housing. The storage and distribution of pig slurry on farmland affect the environment as they are associated with, among others, the emission of various types of gaseous pollutants, mainly CH4, CO2, N2O, NH3, H2S, and other odorants. Methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are greenhouse gases (GHGs) which contribute to climate change by increasing the greenhouse effect. Ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are malodorous gases responsible for the occurrence of odour nuisance which, due to their toxicity, may endanger the health and lives of humans and animals. NH3 also influences the increase of atmosphere and soil acidification. The article presents the environmental impact of greenhouse gases and odorous compounds emitted from pig slurry. Key gaseous atmospheric pollutants such as NH3, H2S, CH4, CO2 and N2O have been characterized. Furthermore, methods to reduce the emission of odours and GHGs from pig slurry during its storage and agricultural usage have been discussed. © 2018 Marta Marszałek et al., published by Sciendo 2018.

AB  - In order to enhance the adsorption capacity of activated carbon (AC) from cocoa pod husk (CPH) and reuse the solution after the acid-leaching of CPH as a liquid fertilizer, CPH was first leached by acid and then used as a precursor (CPH-A) for preparing ACs by physical activation at a temperature range of 650–850 °C in this work. Based on the proximate analysis, mineral compositions, thermogravimetric analysis, and thermochemical properties, the differences between CPH and CPH-A were investigated. The chemical and pore properties of the resulting ACs were further studied. The results show that the pretreatment of CPH with hydrochloric acid led to removal of over 90% of the ash content in the CPH, mainly composed of potassium minerals. The Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) surface area of the AC derived from CPH-A at 650 °C is 355.8 m2/g, significantly larger than that (i.e., 1.1 m2/g) of the AC derived from CPH. The higher activation temperature (e.g., 900 °C) is beneficial to the pore development of the resulting AC (e.g., BET surface area ˃ 1300 m2/g). In addition, the carbon (C) and sulfur (S) contents of the resulting ACs indicate an increasing trend as the temperature increased from 650 to 850 °C, but a decreasing trend in the hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) contents. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Phosphorus is an essential element that at high concentrations generates eutrophication of aquatic systems. In this study, we used batch and continuous tests to evaluate the efficiency of a Technosol to retain the phosphorus present (as phosphate) in aqueous samples. Materials and methods: Phosphate sorption on Technosol was studied through batch and continuous experiments. Sorption kinetics and isotherms were investigated at different phosphate loadings and pH. In batch tests, we have determined how the presence of different anions (bicarbonate, sulphate, chloride, chromate and molybdate) affected phosphate retention. In continuous flow systems, phosphate immobilization was assessed as a function of flow rate, pH and Technosol concentration. Finally, the potential reutilization of the column was evaluated using consecutive sorption-desorption cycles. Results and discussion: Phosphate sorption follows a pseudo-second-order kinetics model and a Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum sorption capacity ranged from 7.1 to 18.5 mg g−1, with larger values obtained at the highest pH. The main mechanisms involved in the sorption process were precipitation (as Ca-P minerals) and surface adsorption. In the column experiments, we observed a sorption reduction from 6.19 ± 0.06 to 2.37 ± 0.06 mg g−1 as the flow rate increased from 1.5 to 5.0 mL min−1. In addition, the retention capacity decreased by 14% when the height of the reactive layer was halved. Finally, the retention capacity of the Technosol spolic silandic recovered well after several sorption-desorption cycles, reaching 40% of the original value after first and second cycles. Conclusions: The material effectively retained phosphate in batch and continuous flow systems. The Technosol spolic silandic is considered an efficient sorbent to remove the excess of phosphate from the soil solution and the aqueous system. This material may be a useful tool to mitigate or minimize two important environmental problems: eutrophication and the scarcity of natural sources of phosphate. The Technosol can thus be recycled as a phosphate-rich amendment and the leachates can be used to produce liquid fertilizer. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The utilization of organic liquid fertilizer PAL-1 as the culture medium of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris was investigated for the purpose of biodiesel production. Cell growth and lipid accumulation in PAL-1 were evaluated and compared with those in the artificial medium BG-11. Cells showed mixotrophic growth when utilizing the organic liquid fertilizer PAL-1. The rates of cell growth (0.143 d-1) and N consumption (14.9 mg/L/d) in PAL-1 were almost the same as those in BG-11, under the presence of 2% CO2-enriched aeration and light irradiation. Lipid synthesis was triggered in PAL-1 on day 4, when nitrogen was completely consumed, and the lipid content reached up to 48% thereafter. Lipid productivity could be enhanced using repeated-batch cultivation in which cells were exposed to N limitation repeatedly, and thus lipid synthesis was induced while maintaining a sufficiently high cell density. © 2018, The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Preliminary survey showed that organic waste from the market is about 18.77%, or second largest in the total waste generation. Its management becomes a challenge, because it is not comprised only of organics but also mixed with small amount of plastics; therefore, conventional biological process will not achieve their maximum efficiency. Wet torrefaction is a thermal process in hot water medium, which will dissolve organic materials into water, effectively converting most solids into liquid product. Banana fruit stem and cabbage were chosen as the mixed organic waste representative, and treated in a 2.5 L reactor using saturated steam in the temperature range of 175 to 225 °C before being analyzed for their heating value in solid products as fuel precursors, and their nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) contents in liquid products as liquid fertilizer precursors. It was found that for cabbage, the wet torrefaction process at 200 °C and 90 min resulted in 15.59 MJ/kg product heating value with NPK content of 3.43%. For banana fruit bunch stem, the wet torrefaction process at 225 °C and 30 min resulted in 17.64 MJ/kg product heating value with NPK content of 5.13%. It can be concluded that wet torrefaction process can simultaneously produce solid and liquid product as solid fuel and liquid fertilizer, respectively. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - Small-scale biomethane production is a promising option to meet a domestic energy supply in Thailand. As part of domestic energy policies in Thailand (new Alternative Energy Development Plan), a biogas plant with 400 kg-wet/d capacity manufactured by Japanese companies was installed at a university in Thailand in 2013. For sustainable operation of the plant, the primary energy demand (PED) and life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission associated with well-to-tank, WTT (the food waste transport, conversion to biomethane and biomethane storage) are assessed. GHGs emission associated with well-to-wheel, WTW (the food waste transport, conversion to biomethane, biomethane storage and driving fuelled by the biomethane) are revealed. Economic analysis is also implemented based on the actual operating data including digestate price derived from N-P-K nutrient management (0.2689 THB/kg), and payback time sensitivity analysis. Primary energy demand associated with WTT processes was 0.68 MJ/MJ-CH4. GHG emission from WTW processes is 132.0 kg-CO2eq/km, which is less than one third that of the other biofuels (biohydrogen, biomethanol, bio-dimethylether and Fischer-Tropsch diesel). The economic analysis showed that food waste disposal income and electricity sales are hot spot in the revenue and interest payment and maintenance cost has high impact in expenditure. The most sensitive parameter is biomethane yield, which should be kept higher for profitable operation of the biogas plant in Thailand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Water-soluble liquid fertilizer containing humic acid is one of the important directions of liquid fertilizer development in the future. It not only has the high utilization efficiency and the abilities of water saving, environmental protection and increasing production, but also has the functions of enhancing plant resistance, promoting flower bud differentiation and development, and improving the quality of crops. According to the analysis, 90% of the nutrients of livestock and poultry manure and straw were preserved after biogas fermentation, and about 1/3 of nutrients entered biogas slurry. Using biogas liquid to develop liquid fertilizer could alleviate the problem of methane elimination and save water resources, besides producing high quality liquid fertilizer. In order to explore the feasible method for the development of water-soluble liquid fertilizer containing humic acid, in this paper, biogas slurry, formula fertilizer of cucumber, chelating agent, and stabilizer were used as the main raw materials, and the effects of different process parameters (amount of biogas slurry, amount of stabilizer, amount of chelating agent, reaction temperature and reaction time) on the performance of water-soluble liquid fertilizer containing humic acid were studied. The results showed that amount of biogas slurry, amount of chelating agent, amount of stabilizer, reaction temperature and reaction time had an important effect on the content of water insoluble substance in liquid fertilizer containing humic acid. In the case of the addition of certain amount of biogas solution, the impact importance of each factor was additive amount of stabilizer > reaction temperature > additive amount of chelating agent > reaction time. Adjusting amount of chelating agent, amount of stabilizer, reaction temperature and reaction time could reduce the concentration of water insoluble matter to a certain extent, and improve the total nutrient concentration in the liquid fertilizer. The excellent process parameters for preparing water-soluble liquid fertilizer were formula fertilizer of cucumber accounting for 39.6% of mixed material, biogas slurry 59%, stabilizer 0.4%, chelating agent 4%, reaction temperature of 40℃, and reaction time of 1.5 h. Under such conditions, the content of total nutrient was 220.47 g/L, humic acid was 33.25 g/L and insoluble matter was 18.6 g/L. The full utilization of biogas slurry was an important guarantee for the sustainable operation of biogas projects. From another point of view, under the premise of meeting the basic quality standard of liquid fertilizer, it was also of great practical significance to achieve maximum utilization of biogas slurry. The method not only realizes the full utilization of biogas slurry, but also has the advantages of high content of humic acid and nitrogen. It provides technical support for developing high quality water-soluble liquid fertilizer containing humic acid using biogas slurry. © 2018, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - Organic amendments have been shown to improve the quality of agricultural soils. Thus, the use of sewage sludge compost tea as a fertilizer can be considered a worthy and environmentally friendly alternative as it also offers the option of recycling sludge at the same time. However, an in-depth knowledge of how the addition of this product affects soil microbial diversity is still necessary. As such, the main objective of this study was to evaluate, at a microcosm level, the effects of irrigation with sewage sludge compost tea in an olive grove soil, focusing on the changes in the total bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). For this purpose plastic pots were filled with olive grove soil, watered with different amounts of water and/or compost tea, and incubated at 21 and 35°C for a period of 90 days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting, real-time PCR, and 454-pyrosequencing analysis were performed. Our results suggested that the addition of sewage sludge compost tea (liquid fertilizer) slightly increased the soil biological diversity during the incubation time which suggests that sewage sludge compost tea did not have any negative effects in the soil microbiota. Accordingly and regardless of the incubation temperature, significant changes in the soil community structure were not observed throughout the experiment, suggesting that the treated soils maintained their microbiological stability. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Compared with composting, hydrothermal treatment (HTT) technology can dramatically shorten the duration for manure waste treatment. This study firstly investigated the effect of HTT on solubilization of N, P and organics from swine manure, and then evaluated the phytotoxicity of liquid product from hydrothermally treated manure by seed germination test. Results show that 98% of N in manure could be converted into soluble form after HTT at 200 °C for 60 min. Soluble P in hydrothermally treated manure (at 150 °C for 60 min) was 2.7 times that in raw manure. The germination indices (GI) were all greater than 100% when the liquid product (from HTT at 150 °C for 60 min) or its diluted samples being used. Results from this study suggest that HTT could be a promising technology for producing safe and value-added liquid fertilizers from swine manure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - High temperature affects color and quality of grape fruits, especially at the maturing stage. In this study, (S)-2-cis-abscisic acid (S-ABA)-containing fertilizer was applied to 'Kyoho' grapes in order to improve their fruits quality. In 2012, 0, 20, 100 or 400 mg L-1 S-ABA-containing liquid fertilizer was sprayed on fruits at 6, 16 and 24 days after veraison (DAV). Anthocyanin level was increased and titratable acidity (TA) was declined by the S-ABA treatments. The treatment of 400 mg L-1 S-ABA at 24 DAV significantly increased fruits weight and total soluble solids (TSS). In 2014, 100 or 400 mg L-1 S-ABA and racemic RS-ABA were applied to 'Kyoho' grape fruits at 7, 14 and 21 DAV. The application of S-ABA resulted in the increments of anthocyanin by 100 and 400 mg L-1 at 14 and 21 DAV. Fruit weight and TSS were not influenced by the treatments, while TA was decreased by the treatments at 14 and 21 DAV. RS-ABA was less effective than S-ABA, probably because concentration of active (S)-2-cis-ABA form in the commercially available synthetic RS-ABA was lower than that of S-ABA containing-fertilizer. (S)-2-cis- and (R)-2-cis-ABA were isomerized into isomers such as (S)-2-trans-ABA and (R)-2-trans-ABA after UV exposure for 3 days. Effects of S- and RS-ABA on fruit quality were discussed. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - The fertilization methods and technologies rapid development using extra-radicular fertilizers and liquid fertilizers with or without organic substances is due to both their controlled application possibilities depending on the vegetation phases, crop, agrochemical background, and nutrition deficiencies and efficiency increase of the indices regarding the fertilization costs -economical results The best agricultural practices application, compatible with the new climatic conditions, can actively contribute to environment preservation and protection at the same time with crops constancy and production capability securement. Fertilizers application with solid or liquid humic substances ensures all the needed compounds and minerals for creating and maintaining a fertile soil. At the same time their efficiency depends on multiple factors that include temperature, humidity, previous agricultural practices, soil physical and chemical characteristics, pesticides or other polluting products residues, microbial population present in the soil and the activity it develops. The humic compounds mediate pesticides and toxins degradation and contaminated soils biological reparation rests on humus help in microbial degradation. The paper presents the results obtained by radicular application of two experimental NPK type fertilizers with humic substances at the sunflower crop in vegetation pots. The fertilizers have been physically and chemically characterized and agrochemically tested as compared to an unfertilized control and two fertilized controls with a complex 15.15.15 NPK fertilizer in 120 and 180 kg/ha doses. The experimental fertilizers were applied in portions upon crops sowing and during vegetation in three 200, 300, respectively 400 liters fertilizer/ha and ensured significant gains as compared to the controls.The extracted humic substances and the fertilizers were physically and chemically characterized as well as through differential thermal gravimetric analysis and FT-IR spectrometry. The vegetal material and the sunflower seeds were analyzed regarding the nitrogen phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, and manganese contents. © 2018 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L.

AB  - Fertiliser production makes a significant contribution to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis of emission factors was carried out on a data set spanning from 2013 to 2015 for the whole chain of fertiliser production from raw materials up to the final products – ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, urea in prilled form and liquid fertilisers based on them. The carbon footprint was calculated in compliance with the Standard ISO 14067:2013. The calculations were based on the gate-to-gate analysis. Analysis showed carbon footprint reduction after technological modifications – modernisation of a Benfield section, for example, absorption of gaseous CO2 in propylene carbonite and potassium carbonite solutions, with the recovery of the pure CO2, resulting in reduction of energy consumption from 35.3 to 33.3 GJ/Mg NH3 – change of the N2O decomposition catalysts, resulting in reduction of N2O emission factor from 2 to 0.9 kg N2O/Mg HNO3. Life cycle assessment is a useful tool, which can be used in the decision-making process for factory modernisation and improvement the production processes. © 2018, Desalination Publications.

AB  - A 3-year study was conducted at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, NM, to investigate the effects of different fertilization treatments on turf performance when water conservation strategies are applied. These strategies include the use of non-potable saline irrigation water and the use of efficient subsurface irrigation systems. Two low water use warm-season grasses, “Princess 77” bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.) and “Sea Spray” seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum O. Swartz), were irrigated with either potable [Electrical Conductivity (EC) = 0.6 dS/m] or saline (EC = 3.1 dS/m) water from either an overhead or a subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system. Four different fertilizers, liquid slow release, granular slow release, granular urea and liquid urea, were applied at two rates: 10 and 20 g N m−2 year−1 for “Sea Spray” and 20 and 30 g N m−2 year−1 for “Princess 77.” Spring green-up, summer quality and fall colour retention were determined using digital image analysis, visual quality ratings and normalized difference vegetation index. Generally, subsurface drip-irrigated grasses were slower to green-up than overhead irrigated ones. “Sea Spray” irrigated from the SDI system took 18, 28 and 15 days longer to reach 80% green cover in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, than their sprinkler-irrigated counterparts. The combination of “Princess 77” and overhead irrigation reached 80% green cover 35 (in 2010), 34 (in 2011) and 12 (in 2012) days faster than SDI-irrigated “Princess 77.” Fertilization rate and type had no effect on summer turfgrass quality of “Princess 77” irrigated from a sprinkler system throughout the research period reaching ratings of greater than 7 during all 3 years. Similar results were observed for “Princess 77” irrigated from a SDI system during 2010 and 2011. Summer quality of sprinkler-irrigated “Sea Spray” was negatively affected by liquid fertilization. During two of three summers, visual quality of plots fertilized with either liquid slow release or liquid urea was lower than “Sea Spray” fertilized with granular fertilizer. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of fertilization on bermudagrass and seashore paspalum over a wider nitrogen range including both granular and foliar products. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - This study investigates the efficiency of seaweed liquid fertilizer (SLF) prepared from combinations of different seaweeds (Sargassum polyphyllum, Turbinaria ornata, Gelidiopsis sp., Padina tetrastomatica, Gracilaria corticata) as a stimulant for the growth of Vigna radiata (Mung) as well as its antagonistic activity against fungal pathogens (Alternaria solani, Rhizoctonia solani., Sarocladium oryzae). 100% SLF was prepared, which was further diluted to 60%, 40%, and 20%. Seeds were soaked in four different concentrations of the SLF (20%, 40%, 60%, and 100%) for 12 hr and planted. After 60 d, the root and shoot length were increased by 14% and 16%, respectively, with SLF (100%). The carbohydrate and protein concentrations were also increased by 70% and 86%, respectively, at 100% SLF. The concentration of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids were found to be increased by 20%, 43%, and 28%, respectively, with 100% SLF. Further, the SLF (60% and 100%) successfully inhibited the growth of fungal pathogen A. solani but the other tested strains were found to be resistant. The present study indicates that 100% SLF concentration acts as both biostimulant and biofungicide for A. solani and thus, this SLF could be used as a potential alternative to the chemical fertilizers. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Aiming to the problem that picking hole mechanism of deep-fertilization liquid fertilizer applicator can not meet fertilizer-spraying needle inserted and pulled out of soil vertically all the time, according to the meshing characteristic of combining gears for oval non-circular with round gears. A new kind of picking hole mechanism was designed to achieve variable speed and vertical posture at picking hole. The meshing principle of oval gears were used, which controlled every moment change of angular velocity to achieve variable speed picking hole in the working period, the characteristic met specific requirement, which had horizontal velocity of fertilizer-spraying needle trend to zero inserted and pulled out of soil, small hole mouth was achieved. To achieve small hole mouth and picking hole for vertical posture, the mathematics model of mechanism was established, with the rotational speed of picking hole mechanism of 120 r/min, forward speed of 1.2 m/s and depth of picking hole of 80 mm as constraint conditions, structure parameters of mechanism were obtained, including half shaft distance of oval gear shaft of 39.9 mm, eccentricity of 0.15, diameter of circular gear pitch curve of 68 mm and length of fertilizer-spraying needle of 140 mm, and virtual experiment was verified by using the ADAMS software. The experiments of high-speed camera and picking hole were carried out, the trajectory shape of fertilizer-spraying needle, curve of level absolute velocity and hole width were obtained when the forward speed was 1.2 m/s, rotational speed of picking hole mechanism was 120 r/min and depth of picking hole was 80 mm, the reasons for the formation of such results were analyzed. Experiments results showed that fertilizer-spraying needle still guaranteed the target that had small hole mouth and picking hole for vertical posture. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - Quality of liquid fertilizer is determined by the content of nutrients and other chemical factors such as pH and EC. This research aimed to examine nutrient contents and dynamic of pH and EC of liquid fertilizer made from goat manure in combination with sugar and ammonium sulfate (ZA) and using Effective Microorganisms (EM) as the decomposer. This research was conducted by employing 3 x 3 factorial experiment with three replications. Each treatment combination was applied in 20 L of water. The first factor was the quantity of sugar which consisted of 3 levels: 12.5, 25, and 50 g L-1 of water. The second factor was the quantity of ZA which consisted of 3 levels: 25, 37.5, and 50 g L-1 of water. All combinations were added by 100 g of air dried goat manure L-1 of water and EM solution 1 ml L-1 of water, and incubated for five months. Results of the experiment indicated that the increasing concentration of ZA resulted in the significantly increase of N total and S total. Increasing concentration of sugar resulted in decreasing pH and increasing lactic acid; whereas, increasing concentration of ZA followed by increasing Electrical Conductivity (EC). There was no significantly change of pH and EC of the liquid fertilizer during five months incubation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Waste management is a part of the green campus achievement program. Universitas Gadjah Mada has a Standard Operating Procedure for managing produced waste. Waste produced by each building or work unit is temporarily accommodated in the waste depot before dumped into the landfill. This research aims to study the waste management system in UGM, in accordance with the concept of a green campus. The concept of green campus to improve the efficiency of waste management needs to be supported by various parties. The success of the green campus program relies on an integrated approach, a sustainable implementation that involves stakeholders of the university. In actualizing the concept of a green campus, the university has its own waste processing system. The organic produced waste is processed into compost, while plastic waste is converted into alternative fuel. Overall, the waste management system that UGM owns is ineffective and inefficient, it was proved by the fact that there is still much waste dumped into the landfill. UGM provides a laboratory that is specialized to process waste that is produced by UGM. It is planned to be able to reduce the amount of waste that is dumped into the landfill. According to the results, vermicomposting technology, the manufacture of liquid fertilizer from leachate, and the manufacture of the composite from a mixture of leaves and paper were offered as solutions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - An effort for increasing soybean production can be conducted by applying liquid fertilizer on soybean cultivation field. The objective of this research was to determine liquid fertilizer spraying performance using knapsack power sprayer TASCO TF-900 on a soybean cultivation field. Performances test were conducted in the Laboratory of Spraying Test and on a soybean cultivation field to determine (1) effective spraying width, (2) droplets diameter, (3) droplets density, (4) effective spraying discharge rate, and (5) effective field capacity of spraying. The research was conducted using 2 methods: (1) one-nozzle spraying, and (2) four- nozzles spraying. Results of the research showed that at a constant pressure of 900 kPa effective spraying width using one-nozzle spraying and four-nozzles spraying were 0.62 m and 1.10 m. A bigger effective spraying width was resulted in a bigger average effective spraying discharge rate and average effective spraying field capacity of 4.52 l/min and 83.92 m2/min on forward walking speed range of 0.94 m/s up to 1.77 m/s. On the contrary, bigger effective spraying width was result in bigger droplets diameter of 502.73 μm and a smaller droplets density of 98.39 droplets/cm2, whereas smaller effective spraying width was resulted in a smaller droplets diameter of 367.09 μm and a bigger droplets density of 350.53 droplets/cm2. One-nozzle spraying method produced a better spraying quality than four-nozzles spraying method, although four-nozzles spraying was resulted in a bigger effective field capacity of spraying. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Bio-fertilizer has been used as an alternative of the chemical fertilizer, Klebsiella oxytoca in organic fertilizer can convert nutrients in the soil to the available form for plant growth. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of Klebsiella oxytoca in the forms of bio-fertilizer and liquid organic fertilizer on the growth of Ipomoea aquatica, Brassica integrifolia and Brassica rapa chinensis. These trials were carried out in four replications of the randomized complete block design (RCBD) in the greenhouse. Results showed that by applying organic fertilizer in I. aquatica, plant growth parameters, soil nutrients and microbial activities were approximately in chemical fertilizer treatment excepted for the nutrient content in plant. The nutrients in B. integrifolia plant that grown in liquid organic fertilizer was lower than soil that apply chemical. On the other hand, these values in B. rapa chinensis which applied with liquid fertilizer was equal (applying fermentation fruit waste) and significant higher (applying molasses) than in the chemical fertilizer application. The result from this study indicated that B. rapa chinensis responsed better B. integrifolia when applied liquid organic fertilizer. The microbial activities of microorganisms were in inverse ratio to the amount of chemical applying. The highest number nitrogen fixing bacteria, phosphate and potassium solubilization bacteria, and Klebsiella oxytoca were found in the soil supplemented with liquid fertilizer. The treatment of 50% of chemical fertilizer in combination with liquid fertilizer could increase the I. aquatica yield and improved soil nutrient. © 2018, Chiang Mai University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) uptake efficiency (PUE; percent of applied P absorbed by roots) for containerized crops is ≈27% to 62%. Reducing P fertilization may increase PUE without decreasing growth and may reduce P leaching from containers, thus mitigating the environmental impact of containerized production while potentially reducing fertilizer input costs for growers. The objective of this study was to determine the minimum P application concentration and the resulting substrate pore-water (i.e., solution residing within and between substrate particles) P concentration that maintains maximal growth of three containerized woody plant taxa grown in pine bark substrate. Hydrangea paniculata Sieb. ‘Limelight’ (hydrangea), Ilex crenata Thunb. ‘Helleri’ (holly), and Rhododendron L. ‘Karen’ (azalea) were potted in pine bark substrate amended with dolomite and micronutrients and grown for 81 d in an open-wall greenhouse. Plants received either one of five constant liquid-feed treatments with varying P concentrations [80 mg·L-1 nitrogen (N), 50 mg·L-1 potassium (K), and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 6.0 mg·L-1 P] or a single application of controlled-release fertilizer (CRF; control) at experiment initiation. Calculated lowest P fertilizer concentration that sustained maximal shoot dry weight (SDW) in hydrangea and azalea was 4.7 and 2.9mg·L-1, respectively, and holly SDW was the same across all liquid fertilizer treatments. In all three taxa, CRF-fertilized plants achieved &lt;50%of maximal SDW observed in liquid fertilized plants. Hydrangea root dry weight (RDW) nearly doubled as fertilizer P increased from 0.5 to 2.0mg·L-1 P, but higher P concentrations did not further increase RDW. Holly RDW was unaffected by liquid P treatment. Pore-water P concentrations of treatments that sustained maximal SDW of hydrangea and azalea were as low as 0.6 and 2.2 mg·L-1 P, respectively. Our findings suggest that when using constant liquid feed, applied P levels more accurately predict plant growth responses than pore-water P levels. © 2018, American Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - The progressive decline of soil organic matter (SOM) threatens the sustainability of arable cropping worldwide. Residue removal and burning, destruction of protected microsites, and the acceleration of microbial decomposition are key factors. Desorption of SOM by ammonia-based fertilizers from organomineral complexes in soil may also play a role. A urea- and molasses-based liquid fertilizer formulation and a urea-based granular formulation were applied at recommended and district practice rates, respectively, to soil leaching columns, with unfertilized columns used as controls. The chemistry of leachate collected from the columns, filled with two sandy soils differing in recent cropping history, was monitored over eight successive wet-dry drainage events. The pH, electrical conductivity, and concentration and species of N in leachate was compared with the concentration and aromaticity of dissolved organic C (DOC) to indicate if salt solutions derived from the two fertilizers extracted SOM from clay mineral sites. Cation exchange capacity and exchangeable cations in the soil were monitored at the start and end of the trial. Fertilizer application increased DOC in leachate up to 40 times above the control, but reduced aromaticity (specific ultraviolet light absorbance at 253.7 nm). Dissolved organic C was linearly proportional to leachate NH4-N concentration. Exchangeable Ca and Mg in soil from fertilized columns at the end of both trials were significantly lower than in unfertilized soil, indicating that ammonium salt solutions derived from the fertilizers extracted cations and variably charged organic matter from soil mineral exchange sites. Desorption of organic matter and divalent cations from organomineral sites by ammonia-based fertilizers may be implicated in soil acidification. © American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.

AB  - Poly-γ-glutamic acid (γ-PGA) produced by Bacillus licheniformis TISTR 1010 was blended with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and irradiated with cobalt-60 γ-rays to produce hydrogels. The most absorbent hydrogels were formed using a γ-PGA to PVA mass ratio of 90:10 and an irradiation dose of 40 kGy. The optimally made hydrogel had a gelation of 60.3 ± 2.4% and a deionized water absorption of 13.6 ± 0.4 g g−1. These hydrogels filled to capacity with a liquid fertilizer solution were used to make a ‘solid’ fertilizer for potting the Dendrobium “Bom” cut orchids for improving the shelf-life for export. The fertilizer absorption by the hydrogel was 2.0 ± 0.8 g g−1. In deionized water, the prepared solid fertilizer released the nutrient sucrose with average release rates of 0.92 ± 0.01 g L−1 h−1 (measured over a 0–10 h interval) and 0.08 ± 0.00 g L−1 h−1 (measured over a 10–168 h interval). The hydrogel solid fertilizer kept the orchids fresh for ∼8 days at 4 °C and ∼7 days at 25 °C. Relative to liquid fertilizer, the solid fertilizer delayed flower opening by 4 days at 25 °C. Use of a γ-PGA (0.5 g L−1) solution alone also delayed flower senescence and opening. Simple empirical models were shown to satisfactorily predict opening and senescence of flowers with cut stems potted in the solid fertilizer and other media. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed to understand Capsicum frutescens growth and plankton abundance in aquaponics culture. A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with six treatments in triplicates comprising of treatment A (positive control using organic liquid fertilizer), B (negative control without fertilizer), C (drip irrigation aquaponics with a water debit of 100 ml/day/plant), D (drip irrigation aquaponics with a water debit of 150 ml/day/plant), E (drip irrigation with a water debit of 200 ml/day/plant), and F (drip irrigation aquaponics with a water debit of 250 ml/day/plant) was applied. The water used in treatments C, D, E, and F contained comet fish feces as fertilizer. C. frutescens growth and plankton abundance were observed. Analysis was conducted using analysis of variance for plant productivity and descriptive analysis for plankton abundance and water quality. The results of this study showed that the highest plant growth was seen in plants receiving F treatment with 50 ml/day drip irrigation. However, no significant difference was found when compared to the positive control with organic artificial fertilizer. Eleven types of phytoplankton and six types of zooplankton were found, with Stanieria sp. as the most abundant phytoplankton and Brachionus sp. and Epistylis sp. as the most abundant zooplanktons. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Advanced oxidation using UV radiation in the presence of H2O2 was applied for decolorization of liquid fertilizer and the resulting liquid fertilizer was utilized to the cultivation of microalga Chlorella vulgaris and biodiesel production. The growth of C. vulgaris was enhanced in decolorized medium. The biomass productivity of C. vulgaris in AOP-treated PAL1 reached 124 mg/L, which was 2.1 times higher than that in original PAL1, 58 mg/L/day. Cellular lipid accumulation was increased in decolorized medium (from 6 to 30%), because fast growing cells consumed nitrogren faster in decolorized medium and thus lipid synthesis was triggered in nitrogen-deficient environment. © 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry

AB  - Hydroponic as one of the protected cultivation practices is very important to be developed in Indonesia due to not only the reduction of arable agricultural lands in lines with increasing of residential demand and other public facilities but also due to the negative influences of climate change as well global warming to plant growth. The effects of liquid fertilizer made from goat manure (LFGM) in combination with AB-Mix on three kinds of foliage vegetable growth was examined in hydroponics. The research was conducted by 3 x 4 factorial experiment and arranged in Completely Randomized Design with 3 replications. The first factor was foliage vegetable consisting of 3 levels: Mustard Green, Lettuce, and Red Spinach. The second factor was the mixture composition of nutrient solution consisting of 4 levels: LFGM + AB-Mix (v/v: 1:1), LFGM + AB-Mix (v/v: 1:3), LFGM + AB-Mix (v/v: 3:1), and A/B mix as control. Results indicated that the application of LFGM + AB-Mix (v/v: 1:3) resulted in similar plant growth as control (AB-Mix application), and also resulted in the highest chlorophyll content of Mustard green. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The abundance of coconut water as a waste of household industry activities in Ponorogo can be obtained. There is still organic matter considered to become a liquid fertilizer where it can be expected to substitute for the use of inorganic fertilizers. The research aims to determine the potential of coconut water as a liquid organic fertilizer involving three types of microorganisms, such as Aspergillus Niger, Pseudomonas putida and Effective Microorganisms (EM4). The experiment was conducted using a mixed bacth reactor with 4 L/ minute of aeration rate and initial microorganism's number of approximately 107 cells/ mL for 10 days. The results suggest that the highest reduction of C-organic and the biggest enhancement of N, P, K can be achieved by a combination of A. Niger and P. putida with 29 %; 100 %, 110 %, 552%, respectively. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

AB  - Bamboo is a potentially economical fuel crop that has not been utilized at a substantial extent for energy generation in Indonesia. As a thermal conversion waste, bamboo ash is particularly interesting due to its high potassium content. This paper discusses the determination of several key parameters of a simple batchwise extraction process to recover potassium in the form of weak solution from bamboo ash. To produce the ash, black bamboo (Gigantochloa atroviolaceae) is charred in a fixed bed combustor. The bamboo char is ground and ashed at 500 °C in an electric furnace. The ash yield is 3.3 %-mass relative to as-received ash, with an ash K2O content of 12.9 %-mass. The ash is ground until passing 100-mesh standard sieve, and extracted by deionized water on a 2-stage laboratory-scale batchwise extractor battery. Process variables include extractror battery configuration (counter-current and co-current), temperature (nominal setting at 45-80 °C), and contact period of 1-6 hours. The concentration of extracted K2O increases asymptotically with temperature and contact time. Counter-current extraction yields more than twice the extract K2O concentration compared to cross-current extraction. The optimum conditions for the counter-current extraction is identified as a temperature of 78 °C and contact time of 4 hours, resulting in a 0.70 %-mass K2O solution concentration. Spot sampling of commercial liquid fertilizer products in Indonesia indicates an equivalent K2O content of 0.08-13.6 %-mass, suggesting the potential of the bamboo ash extract as an intermediate for fertilizer product. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

AB  - Osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR), which integrates forward osmosis (FO) with biological treatment process, has been recently developed to advance wastewater treatment and reuse. During OMBR operation, driven by osmotic pressure gradient, biologically treated water transports from the mixed liquor, through a semi-permeable FO membrane, into a highly concentrated draw solution. Compared to conventional MBR, OMBR has several advantages, including better product water quality, lower fouling propensity, and higher fouling reversibility. OMBR can be operated in the osmotic dilution mode when the draw solution, such as liquid fertilizers or seawater, can be reused or discharged directly. In most cases, OMBR is integrated with an additional process, commonly including reverse osmosis, membrane distillation, and electrodialysis, to form hybrid systems for sustainably reconcentrating draw solutions and producing clean water for reuse. In addition, several membrane processes, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and electrodialysis, are combined with OMBR to address its inherent issue, salinity build-up in the bioreactor, and achieve resource (e.g., nutrients and energy) recovery. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding on the performance of OMBR and its hybrid systems in wastewater reuse and resource recovery. OMBR analogs and their performance are also systematically introduced. Key technical challenges and their potential solutions to the further development of OMBR and its hybrid systems are highlighted. This review sheds light on future research for the further development of OMBR and its hybrid systems. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A unique autothermal thermophilic aerobic digestion (ATAD) process has been used to convert human excreta to liquid fertilizer in Japan. This study investigated the changes in physicochemical and bacterial community characteristics during the full-scale ATAD process operated for approximately 3 weeks in 2 different years. After initiating simultaneous aeration and mixing using an air-inducing circulator (aerator), the temperature autothermally increased rapidly in the first 1 to 2 days with exhaustive oxygen consumption, leading to a drastic decrease and gradual increase in oxidation-reduction potential in the first 2 days, reached > 50°C in the middle 4 to 6 days, and remained steady in the final phase. Volatile fatty acids were rapidly consumed and diminished in the first 2 days, whereas the ammonia nitrogen concentration was relatively stable during the process, despite a gradual pH increase to 9.3. Principal-coordinate analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons using next-generation sequencing divided the bacterial community structures into distinct clusters corresponding to three phases, and they were similar in the final phase in both years despite different transitions in the middle phase. The predominant phyla (closest species, dominancy) in the initial, middle, and final phases were Proteobacteria (Arcobacter trophiarum, 19 to 43%; Acinetobacter towneri, 6.3 to 30%), Bacteroidetes (Moheibacter sediminis, 43 to 54%), and Firmicutes (Thermaerobacter composti, 11 to 28%; Heliorestis baculata, 2.1 to 16%), respectively. Two predominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the final phase showed very low similarities to the closest species, indicating that the process is unique compared with previously published ones. This unique process with three distinctive phases would be caused by the aerator with complete aeration. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Sales transaction is an activity undertaken to sell goods, for example, agricultural medicines, solid fertilizer, liquid fertilizer, and others using cash or credit. Semi Tani Shop is one of the agricultural store located in Tanah Laut. Semi Tani Store has a sales transaction management, inventory stock, and profit calculation done conventionally. The transaction history is written using paper in the calculation of income statement and recording stock of goods. However, there is no bookkeeping sales transaction in any form, and thus it is difficult to monitor the transaction history. This study aims to implement the sales information system of agricultural store sales based on Mobile and test the usability of the application. Sales data is going to be stored on the local computer and the cloud. The sales information system focuses on monitoring reports that can be accessed from anywhere as long as it is connected to the internet and have POS cloud system, i.e. OSPOS (Open Source Point of Sales). The report is in the form of a Stock report, Transaction Report, and income statement. This study uses Prototype method. Implementation results will help Semi Tani Shop owner in the sales management using OSPOS, as well as monitoring the stocks, stock notes in specified quantities (thinning), transaction reports, and income statement using mobile android. This study also concluded the usability engineering in response time that is at limit 1.0 second and average around 0.3 seconds. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this research fall time harvested corn residue (CR) was first mechanically pretreated to produce 5 mm chopped and &lt;500 µm ground particles, which underwent an anaerobic digestion (AD) process to produce biomethane and biofertilizer. Another sample of CR was pretreated by an alkaline hydrothermal (HT) process using 1%, 2% and 3% NaOH to produce solid biocarbon and the resulting alkaline hydrothermal process water (AHTPW), a co-product of biocarbon, underwent fast digestion under AD conditions to produce biomethane and biofertilizer. A predetermined HT process of 240◦C for 30 min was considered and the effect of alkali content on the HT process for biocarbon and biomethane product a rate of 8.21 MJ kg− 1 and 9.23 MJ kg− 1 of raw CR, respectively. Among the three selected alkaline HT processes, the 1% NaOH HT process produced the highest hybrid bioenergy of 11.39 MJ kg− 1 of raw CR with an overall energy recovery of 62.82% of raw CR. The AHTPW of 2% and 3% NaOH HT-treated CR did not produce considerable amount of biomethane and their biocarbons contained 3.44 MJ kg− 1 and 3.27 MJ kg− 1 of raw CR of bioenergy, respectively. The biomethane produced from 5 mm chopped CR, &lt;500 µm ground CR and 1% alkaline AHTPW for 30 days retention time were of 275.38 L kg− 1 volatile solid (VS), 309.59 L kg− 1 VS and 278.70 L kg− 1 VS, respectively, compared to non-treated CR of 144-187 L kg− 1 VS. Nutrient enriched AD digestate is useable as liquid fertilizer. Biocarbon, biomethane and biofertilizer produced from the 1% alkaline HT process at 240◦C for 30 min can reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Ontario. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - There are hugh amount of traditional market organic wastes that may polute the environment. In general, the wastes are utilized for compost making and liquid fertilizer as well for plant. The use of liquid fertilizer from organic wastes of traditional markets opens up opportunities for misplaced cultivation of Setaria grass (Setaria splendida Stapf), which is required by ruminant farms. This research was conducted to evaluate the best mixture of water to the fertilizer in term of its effectiveness on the variables and experimental method using Completely Randomized Design. The treatments were: 6 doses of mixtures namely 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 liters of water, each of which was mixed with 10 liters of liquid fertilizer. The variables measured were the height, the numbers of tillers, the numbers of leaves, and canopy. The results of the study showed that the doses of water in the fertilizer did not indicate any significant differences (P > 0.05) on all variables being studied, however, the linear equation showed that greater concentrations of water in the fertilizer tended to decrease the growth of Setaria grass. Suggested use of water on the liquid fertilizer mixture should be not greater than 30 l-10 l fertilizer. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Livestock waste from cattle farms in Tekelan village, Getasan Subdistrict, Semarang Regency can be grouped into three types, namely solid waste, slurry and waste water. Solid waste (cow dung) was processed into compost, while slurry and waste water were used to make liquid fertilizer. This compost was used as a component of planting media in horticultural crops and potted plants production. We evaluated the toxicity (phytochemical and ecotoxicological) test of compost by using germination index (GI). Vigna radiata seeds are sown on filter paper dampened with compost extract for different times. GI was calculated by relative germination (G) and relative radical length (L). The germination index (GI) = G/G0 x L/L0 x 100, where G0 and L0 are values obtained by distilled water as a control. The results showed that germination bioassay and radical length using aquades and groundwater in Tekelan village did not affect the radical length of Vigna radiata. Technically, groundwater in Tekelan village can be used as a germination bioassay control. The cow dung compost substrate appears to have a major influence on compost toxicity. Mature compost was produced on day 14 with a GI of 104.03. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - In order to improve the precision of mixing fertilizer, this paper has improved its structure on the basis of pulse width modulation of the VENTURI variable fertilization device, and realizes the concentration of liquid fertilizer by pH and EC sensor to make it a closed-loop control Mixed fertilizer device. The device adopts the control strategy of the thickness level 2 adjustment. First, the corresponding duty relation is called according to the measured inlet pressure, and the duty ratio of the solenoid valve PWM control is automatically adjusted. And the fuzzy control algorithm is used to further fine-Tune the duty cycle of PWM so that the concentration of the mixture is as close as possible to the target concentration. Finally, the fuzzy control and PID control of the flow control valve are simulated. The results show that fuzzy control is better than PID control in response speed and overshoot, and both steady - state errors are within ± 3.0%. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, 150 liquid fertilizers in 2012 and 70 liquid fertilizers in 2015 were sampled and analyzed to derive the process monitoring factors for the production of stabilized liquid fertilizer during the liquid composting of pig slurry. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), which are major operating factors of the liquid composting process, tend to increase with the improvement of organic stabilization degree in the liquid composting of pig slurry, but pH and suspended solid (SS) did not show any significant difference regardless of the organic stabilization degree of liquid fertilizer. Electric conductivity (EC), soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCODCr), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonium nitrogen (NH+4-N) showed a significant decreasing tendency, and nitrate nitrogen (N0-3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) showed no significant differences with the improvement of organic stabilization degree in the liquid composting of pig slurry. And there was a significant correlation between the EC, TN, and NH+4-N parameters in the correlation analysis of the chemical properties of the stabilized liquid fertilizer. Therefore, EC, SCODCr, TN, and NH+4-N were derived as chemical parameters that could distinguish the characteristics of stabilized liquid fertilizer. Especially, the EC parameter was evaluated as an useful indicator for the quality control of liquid fertilizer in the monitoring of overall liquid composting process of the pig slurry. © 2018 Kyushu University.

AB  - To allow an impact sprinkler to work in a low working pressure, an air admission structure can be installed coaxially in the water tube of sprinkler to form a water-air two-phase jet. The admitted air can make an impact sprinkler with a more uniform water distribution of irrigation. Further, the air admission pipe can convey liquid fertilizer or pesticide during irrigation, making the impact sprinkler multifunctional. In this paper, a series of experiments were carried out to investigate the capacity of an air admission structure for sucking both air and water into an impact sprinkler. The suction capacity was measured by water mass flow rate and vacuum degree. The structural parameters include inner diameter d, suction pipe engaging length L and nozzle convergent angle θ. All experimental work was conducted by employing 30PY impact sprinkler. When the nozzle convergent angle θ is increased from 30° to 65° under the same working pressure, the water flow rate reduces, and affects the two fluid mixing ratio in the sprinkler. The reference engaging length is zero, where the air admission pipe outlet jut meets the sprinkler nozzle outlet. When the suction pipe engaging length is varied in the range of -4 to 6 mm, the suction capability increases to the maximum from zero gradually and L=2 mm is re-commended because the suction capability is close to the maximum at this length. The sucked water flow rate increases with increasing sprinkler working pressure and inner diameter. Results of this study have formed a base for air admission impact sprinkler application in engineering. © 2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Drainage and Irrigation Machinery Engineering.

Materials and methods: Tomato plants were subjected to three organic nutrient solutions, which consisted of different mixtures of several OMRI (Organic Materials Review Institute) certified nitrogen fertilizers of industrially processed residues: Treatment I: solid and soluble liquid fertilizers of animal raw materials, natural potassium sulphate-non-synthetic, and calcium chloride; Treatment II: solid and soluble liquid fertilizers of animal raw materials, by-product of marine raw material (soluble liquid), natural potassium sulphate-non-synthetic, and calcium chloride; and Treatment III: solid fertilizers of animal raw materials, natural potassium sulphate-non-synthetic, and calcium chloride to 100% [0-30 days after transplanting (DAT)], 125% [31-80 DAT], and 150% [&gt;81 DAT]. The Steiner solution (SS) was used as a control (Treatment IV). Results: Yield did not differ between organic and conventional treatments, ranging from 3.04 to 3.35 kg m-2 while fresh weight in organic treatments was 3.14 compared to 3.2 kg m-2 in plants fed with the SS. No significant differences in plant height or fruit quality were found. The application of organic fertilizers positively affected the total hydrolysable and condensed polyphenols of tomato fruits compared to the control. Twelve phenolic compounds were identified, highlighting 3-Caffeoylquinic acid, salvianolic acid and 5,6-Dihydroxy-7,8,3’,4’-tetramethoxyflavone (Treatment I) and Medioresinol (Lignan) (Treatment II). Conclusions: The results indicated that organic fertilization through animal-based fertilizer application is a feasible alternative for grape tomato production under greenhouse conditions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Variable-rate technology (VRT) has been paid more attentions by farmers in an attempt to match inputs to local growing conditions efficiently. Farmers in every country are highly encouraged to adopt this practice rather than uniform-rate application (URA). However, the standard methods and design used to quantify application accuracy for VRT remain lacking. Therefore, a variable-rate liquid fertilization control system was designed to meet accurate fertilization demand. The designed control system could enable the real-time proportion and mixture of three kinds of liquid fertilizers, namely, N, P and K, in accordance with decision support subsystem. The task controller reads related information and sends such data to the control system, which is responsible for fertilization operation. The controller could realize liquid fertilizer adjusting through the electromagnetic flow control valves. A high-precision flow meter could measure the fertilization amount, which is sent as feedback to the controller to form a closed-loop control system based on the improved proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm that could enhance the stability and accuracy of precision variable-rate liquid fertilization control systems. Comparisons between the actual and planned application rates indicated good performance for both static and field experimental trials. Mathematical models and transfer functions for some functional modules were then constructed by classical theories to derive a system characteristic equation. To verify the static and dynamic performances, the control system was simulated using the Simulink module on Matlab. Results showed that the variable-rate fertilization was in accordance with the planned data and that the signal trace effect was good. The error was less than 5% for fertilization amount and fertilizer proportion, respectively, and the control response time was 6 s. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

AB  - The study entitled “Development of liquid fertilizer application system for planting mechanism” was conducted in laboratory as well as on field at ASPEE Agricultural Research foundation, Tansa, Tal- Wada, Dist.- Palghar. Fertilizer is any organic or inorganic material that is added to soil to supply one or more plant nutrients essential to the growth of plants. Conservative estimates report 30 to 50% of crop yields are attributed to fertilizer. Fertilizer is a key player to enhance crop production by upgrading soil fertility. Liquid fertilizer application has many advantages over solid fertilizer application. Hence, For greatest fertilizer nutrient use efficiency it is important to select the right source, the right timing, the right rate and the right method of application, it can be achieved by developing a mechanism which will place the seed in soil and also precisely apply fertilizer in liquid form at root zone of crop at required rate and discharge. The various components of liquid fertilizer application mechanism such as furrow openers, frame, power transmission system for seed drill, ball valve, liquid tank etc. were designed and developed. The prototype was then tested and evaluated in laboratory by calibrating the ball valve for the required discharge at particular given tractor speed (3.5 km/h, 4.0 km/h and 4.5 km/h), pump pressure (1 kg/cm2, 2kg/cm2 and 3 kg/cm2) and knob position (1, 2 and 3) of ball valve. The optimum requirement of liquid to be applied per meter length was 61-65 ml, hence the maximum value in the optimum range was observed at speed 3 (4.5 km/h), pressure 1 (1 Kg / cm2) and knob position 3 as 64.4 ml.

AB  - [Objectives] This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of the new liquid fertilizer containing fulvic acid for tobacco on metabolism of cembratrien-diols in flue-cured tobacco.[Methods] Fluecured tobacco cultivar 'Yuyan 6' was used as material. The treatments included conventional practice (FP), ordinary liquid fertilizer for tobacco (DF1) and liquid fertilizer containing fulvic acid for tobacco (DF2), which were all applied with drip irrigation. The morphology and density of glandular hairs were observed, the glandular trichome exudates were measured, the relative expressions of CYC-1, CYP71D16, DXR and DXS were determined using RT-qPCR, and the content of solanone and sensory quality were evaluated.[Results] 1) The trichome density in DF2 treatment was higher and the number of long handle trichomes was more than the other two treatments. The content of cembratrien-diols in glandular trichome exudates was in order of DF2 (65.43 μg/cm2) &gt; FP (46.84 μg/cm2) &gt; DF1(39.8 μg/cm2); 2) The relative expression of CYC-1, CYP71D16, DXR and DXS in DF2 treatment were significantly higher than in DF1 treatment, which were 12.45 times, 3.54 times, 3.22 times and 3.44 times than FP treatment and 4.11 times, 5.71 times, 2.44 times and 2.28 times of those in DF1, respectively; 3) The content of solanone in modulated flue-cured tobacco leaves in DF2 treatment was higher than in the other treatments and reached 112.27 μg/g, which is 2.93 times and 1.99 times of that in FP and DF1, respectively. The sensory quality of tobacco in DF2 treatment was better than in the other treatments in 2015 to 2016.[Conclusions] The fulvic acid contained in the liquid fertilizer stimulates the expression levels of genes related cembratrien-diols synthesis, meliorated foliar secretion of flue cured tobacco and improved the content of solanone and the sensory quality evaluation. © 2018 Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences,Editorial Department of Journal of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizer.

AB  - Bio-based fertilizers are currently gaining interest as a method for reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and as a means for safe disposal of biomass waste. Feathers, which are an abundantly available biomass and have a high N content, are a potential source of fertilizer nutrients. In this study, chicken feathers were subjected to hydrothermal treatment (HTT) with lime addition in the temperature range of 140–200°C to obtain a high N containing liquid product that can be used as a liquid fertilizer. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of HTT conditions on the feather solubilization rate and the properties of the liquid products. The results showed that HTT with a reaction temperature of 180°C, a reaction time of 30 min, feather-water ratio of 1:5, and lime addition is sufficient to solubilize as high as 83% of the chicken feather protein. The produced liquid contained nitrogen of up to 3.4% and total amino acid content of 13.6%. These results indicate the potential utilization of soluble hydrolyzed feather obtained from the HTT process for liquid N fertilizer. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 37: 375–382, 2018. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog.

AB  - In this study, composite hydrogels with interpenetrated polymer networks (IPNs), based on bacterial cellulose (BC) and poly(acrylic acid-co-N,N′-methylene-bis-acrylamide) (PAA), were synthesized by radical polymerization and characterized herein for the first time. Liquid fertilizer (LF) formulations, containing potassium, phosphorus, ammonium oxides and micronutrients, were encapsulated directly into the IPNs of the composite hydrogels during synthesis. Thermal analyses and scanning electron microscopy of control and composite xerogels highlighted the formation of IPNs between BC and PAA. Swelling determinations confirmed the influence of the crosslinker and of the liquid fertilizer concentration upon the density of the IPNs. Further rheology studies and release profiles indicated how the presence of BC and the increase of the crosslinking density of IPNs improved the mechanical strength and the release profile of LF for the innovative composite BC-PAA hydrogels. Results regarding the fertilizer release indicated that the presence of the BC led to a more controlled liberation of the fertilizer proving that this new formulation is potentially viable for application in agricultural practices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - Liquid compound fertilizers (LCF) are aqueous salt solutions which nourish the soil. They contain nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sometimes calcium, magnesium and micronutrients. An LCF solution has practically no insoluble residue and contains the elements in a fully digestible form and is a high-speed, highly effective fertilizer. It is important to assess the equilibrium in the solid-liquid system when creating liquid compound fertilizers, since their basic properties, concentration and crystallization temperature, depend on it. The aim of the study was to determine properties of a liquid multicomponent (K+, NH+4, Cl- and PO3-4) system. This liquid multicomponent system, which was obtained as a by-product in the conversion of KCl and NH4H2PO4, can be used as a liquid fertilizer. This work investigates liquid fertilizers’ chemical composition and their physicochemical properties, such as crystallization temperature, pH, density, viscosity and corrosivity. In order to increase nitrogen concentration, ammonium nitrate was added. Composition of the solid phase obtained by crystallization was identified by methods of chemical and instrumental analysis (radiography, infrared molecular absorption spectroscopy and optical microscopy). The results show that all properties of liquid fertilizers are best when the concentration of NH4NO3 in liquid solutions equals 8%. © 2018, CI and CEQ. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the impact of different liquid fertilisers on selected physiological parameters in order to evaluate the drought tolerance of cherry tomato seedlings. The following physiological parameters were investigated: total phenolic and flavonoid content, total antioxidant capacity and proline content of leaf extracts. Total phenolic and flavonoid content were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminium chloride colorimetric methods, respectively. The ferric-reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP assay) was used to measure the total antioxidant capacity, while proline content was evaluated according to the method of Bates. The contents of proline, total phenolics and flavonoids were significantly higher in the leaves of cherry tomato seedlings exposed to water stress, which suggests that the higher synthesis of these substances by plants represents an important defence mechanism of drought tolerance. The results also indicate that the application of all the used fertilisers in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions can significantly increase the content of phenol compounds and total antioxidant capacity of plants under normal growth conditions, thus improving survival under subsequent stress. © 2018 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

AB  - With development of internet and information technology, the traditional agricultural production cannot meet people's demand. The IoT (Internet of Things) technology is now taking this opportunity to modernize agriculture especially the greenhouse planting industry. This paper proposed a novel intelligent greenhouse cultivation system which not only liberate the farmers' labor force but also break constraints on disastrous weather shock, pest outbreak and other undesirable environment limitations. This system have been put into practice in southeastern China, including four functional parts, which are environmental parameters collection, data transmission, information processing, and data regulation and feedback control. These useful data acquired from IoT sensors were utilized to evaluate plant growth and predict the amount of liquid fertilizer to minimize waste of resources. Besides, a reliable PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) was adopted to enhance resistance to interference. Meanwhile, remote computers were adopted as a monitoring center to guarantee the flexibility of whole control system. © 2018, IGI Global.

AB  - The performance test and parameter optimization of variable spraying liquid fertilizer machine was conducted in this research for the uniform spraying of foliar fertilizer. A crop protection of high-clearance tractor with a variable sprayer was used in the experiment. According to the parameter design, three factors and three levels of test were performed based on the Box-Behnken center-united experimental design principles. The performance tests were combined with response surface methodology to analyze spray parameters such as machine walking speed, spray flow rate and plot distance test which would influence Droplet distribution uniformity. A mathematical model was established by using Design-Expert 8.0 software, and the model was analyzed to obtain the optimal combination of spray parameters. The optimized spray parameter combination is: machine walking speed is 4.5km/h, the spray flow rate is 375L/hm2, and the distance between the plots is 3m. Under this condition, the minimum variation coefficient of droplet distribution is 10.759%, and the relative error is 9.1% compared with the model prediction value of 9.78%. The results of the study can provide operators with reasonable operating conditions when fertilizing. © 2018

AB  - The present research was carried out to investigate the effects of different fertilizer treatments on grain yield and yield components of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) 'Harenda' cultivar. The five treatments were as follows: control (standard NPK fertilization), standard NPK fertilization plus liquid NPK (10-11-11) fertilizer, standard NPK fertilization plus liquid NPK (10-11-11) fertilizer with microelements, standard NPK fertilization plus calcium micronized suspension fertilizer, and standard NPK fertilization plus Cu, Mn, Zn, Ca micronized suspension fertilizers. The field trials were conducted in 2017 at the Experimental Site of Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation - State Research Institute in Pulawy, Poland. Applications of calcium micronized suspension foliar fertilizer and a mixture of Cu, Mn, Zn, Ca micronized suspension fertilizers significantly increased grain yield of spring wheat, respectively by 44.5% and 38.6% in comparison with control (standard NPK fertilization). These fertilizer treatments also enhanced yield components of spring wheat. Moreover, micronized suspension fertilizers (Ca and the mixture of Cu, Mn, Zn, Ca) had a significant effect on ear number and thousand grain weight of spring wheat compared to control and NPK fertilizers. Liquid NPK and micronutrient-enriched NPK fertilizers had a significant effect on thousand grain weight compared to control. © 2018 Jelgava : Latvia University of Agriculture.

AB  - ADVANCES IN NITROGEN (N) fertiliser use efficiency include subsurface application and the use of enhanced efficiency fertiliser (EEF) formulations to reduce losses associated with gaseous emissions and leaching. However, results from field trials do not always show the yield increase required to cover the added cost incurred with the purchase of EEFs. Traditionally, building the soil organic N pool was the main strategy to reduce leaching losses and to better match N supply with crop demand. Nitrogen in the organic form is less prone to leaching and volatilisation, and the frequency of dry/wet cycles with the onset of summer storms stimulates N mineralisation when the crop demand for N is greatest. Results from a leaching trial using a liquid urea mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) fertiliser indicate the inclusion of molasses in the formulation immobilised some of the N fertiliser within 10 days of application, adding to the slow-release organic N pool in the soil. Mass balance results indicate per unit of N fertiliser applied, the N supply in soil removed from leaching columns 17 weeks after liquid fertiliser application was significantly greater than the N supply in soil removed from columns fertilised with the granular product. The inclusion of molasses in the liquid fertiliser formulation provides growers with an alternative EEF, harnessing the organic slow-release capacity of soil microbes. Copyright © 2018 ASSCT.

AB  - The paper presents the results of the experiments on a sterile dump resulted from surface mining of lignite in Rovinari, Gorj County, where, was been tested the effect of a variety of fertilizer as: liquid fertilizers based on humates extracted from lignite, complex mineral fertilizer (N105 P105 K105 and N150 P150 K150), farmyard manure (20, 40 and 60 t/ha), compost (20, 40 and 60 t/ha), and the mixture of the two types of organic fertilizers with mineral fertilizer. Two test plants, corn, and sunflowers have been used. All the tested fertilizers have resulted in statistically assured harvest increases in both crops. The applied treatments led to statistically assured changes in soil chemical properties (pH, contents of humus, total nitrogen, mobile phosphorus, mobile potassium, cadmium, copper, cobalt, nickel, manganese, lead and zinc). For the corn crop, the best results were obtained in the treatment fertilized with 40 t/ha compost plus 100 kg N/ha, that provided a yield about 99% higher than control. The application of 60 t/ha of compost provided a yield increase of 82% and the humates-based liquid fertilizer at the dose of 150 l/ha provided a statistically assured yield increase of 55%. Sunflower crops have provided very significant production increases in fertilized variants with at least 40 t/ha compost, and those fertilized with complex mineral fertilizers. The analysis of corn leaves to determine the nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, zinc, iron and manganese content did not reveal statistically significant changes under the influence of applied treatments. © SGEM 2018.

AB  - This article addresses one of the most current and worrying issues in our environmental, social and economic environment, since it is focused on generating a correct treatment and destination of the organic and agricultural wastes that are generated through the daily activities of daily life. For this, in the city of Machala, we have applied the use of biodigestors as a medium for the production of CH4 and CO2 (greenhouse gases) by anaerobic decomposition of these residues with the objective of obtaining bioenergetic and organic resources, since when they are treated they generate economic, environmental and social benefits, for example; generate electricity from which the same producers generate economic savings and a greater profit, production of liquid fertilizer, organic-solid, which is beneficial to them. © 2018.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of marine brown alga Sargassum polycystum extract on growth and biochemical parameters of Vigna radiata and Vigna mungo. Methods: Different concentrations of algal extracts (0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, and 5.0%) were prepared and applied to the crops at every 10-day intervals under natural conditions. After 30 d, the plants were harvested to evaluate the growth and biochemical parameters. Results: Seaweed liquid fertilizers treated seedlings showed maximum growth in 3.0% concentration when compared to the untreated seedlings. Similarly, biochemical parameters such as photosynthetic pigments, protein, reducing sugar, total sugar and amino acids exhibited increases in 3.0% concentration seaweed extract. Decreases in growth and biochemical parameters were noticed in concentrations higher than 3.0%. Conclusions: Presence of micronutrients and growth regulating substances in the liquid extract help healthier and faster productivity of the crop. © 2018 by the Asian Pacific Journal of Reproduction.

AB  - We assessed the long-term application effects of slurry composting bio-filtration (SCB) liquid fertilizer on red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) yield and soil response. Our study used a randomized complete block design with three replicates over five years (2007 to 2011). We evaluated seven nitrogen treatments: control, five rates of SCB (SCB0, SCB1, SCB2, SCB3, and SCB4), and chemical fertilizer (Urea3). SCB was used as basal fertilization and three top dressing doses of urea at the 30th, 60th, and 90th day after transplanting were applied. For plant analysis, fresh fruit yield, N uptake, fruit N use efficiency (FNUE), and quality (soluble sugar and capsaicinoid concentrations) were measured; and soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic matter, inorganic N, P, exchangeable K, Ca, Mg, and Na, Zn, Fe, and Cu were analyzed. In this study, fresh fruit yield for Urea3 was similar to SCB3 and SCB4. Fruit soluble sugar and capsaicinoid concentrations were the same for all N treatments. The lowest FNUE was shown under SCB0 and the highest FNUE was under SCB4. Five years of SCB treatment had no effect on soil chemical properties. For example, soil pH, EC, and soil organic matter content did not show any changes for all N treatments, regardless of N fertilizer source, and soil P was not influenced by increasing SCB rates. Also, the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu did not show any difference among treatments. Although the concentrations of K and Na in soil increased with SCB rate, the concentration of K was still less than the recommended K level from the National Academy of Agricultural Science, and the sodium adsorption ratio indicated that the increased Na may not adversely affect growing crops. Therefore, the accumulation of K and Na was not critical during our study. These results suggest that SCB for basal fertilization can be used as one of the N fertilizer sources, replacing chemical N fertilizer sources. The recommended SCB rate for basal fertilization should be 103 kg N/ha (SCB3) or 128 kg N/ha (SCB4). Consequently, use of SCB liquid fertilizer could provide an alternative source of pre-transplant N fertilizer for red pepper production. © 2018 Korean Society for Horticultural Science.

AB  - Herbal plants and spices, due to their aromatic and medicinal properties, are widely used in pharmacy, cooking, cosmetology and agriculture. The increase in the number of willow plantations for energy crops has enhanced the interest of the salicylic glycosides contained in the willow bark which shows multidirectional pharmacological activity. The small-scale production of herbs and spices requires the application of agricultural machines and horticultural implements adjusted to the area cultivated. In this paper, the comprehensive characteristics of the medicinal properties of willow are presented. Newly developed machines used for the mechanisation of the establishment and cultivation of herbs and spices are also described. The machines presented are a part of the technology developed at the Rzeszow University of Technology which can also be used for the mechanisation of biomass production. In order to improve the physicochemical properties of the soil and increase the amount and quality of yield, natural organic fertilisers can be used. Therefore, the paper presents the correct method of storing manure and a device for the application of solid and liquid fertilizers to the soil as well as a device for monitoring the state of the soil-water environment. © 2018 Polish Society of Ecological Engineering (PTIE).

AB  - Planting into cool and wet conditions exposes soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed and seedlings to pathogens that may reduce plant populations, resulting in lower yield. Recently, fungicides have been labeled for in-furrow applications and marketed to provide additional broad-spectrum protection from soilborne fungi and enhance seedling vigor. Additionally, liquid fertilizers have been promoted recently as a carrier for fungicides to improve yield in some soybean producing areas in the United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a fungicide, starter fertilizer, and a combination of fungicide and starter fertilizer on soybean yield. Field experiments were laid out in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, and Mississippi in the United States and Ontario, Canada, with a total of 14 site-years. A positive yield response was observed with the fungicide and starter fertilizer treatment combination in Arkansas in 2014; however, there was no effect of treatment on soybean yield at any other location or year. Overall, a yield benefit of 1.6 bu/acre (107.6 kg/ha) (P = 0.02) with the fungicide and starter fertilizer treatment was observed across all locations when combined using metaanalysis. In conclusion, our study suggests that the prophylactic application of fungicide and starter fertilizer may not be profitable without the risk of soilborne diseases and nutrient deficiencies. © 2018 American Society of Agronomy and Crop Science Society of America 5585 Guilford Rd., Madison, WI 53711.

AB  - In response to the extensive demands on national and global levels, liquid storage tanks are designed by circumventing environmental pollution. The storage tanks are metallic containersused to store various liquids and chemicals, such as oil, diesel, biodiesel, liquid fertilizer, industrial chemicals, petroleum products etc. The service life of such storage tanks is usually reduced due to corrosion, and one of the effective means of combating corrosion is to use protective coatings on the metal surface.In this study,the effects of polyurea (PU) coating on corrosion behaviour over aluminium and mild steel sub-strateswere investigated. Spray coating technique is used for coating. Pure substrates and coated substrates (unscribed and scribed) are prepared and the corrosion behaviour of PU coated samplesare studied with the help of salt spray test and polarization measurements. The results are recorded and discussed. Furthermore, surface morphology and elemental analysis were studied through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) respectively. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A novel drainage system and animal unit flooring system has recently been developed which maximises the comfort and welfare of animals housed on it and at the same time allows separation of urine and faeces, reducing the conversion of urea to ammonia and thus reducing nitrogen release to the atmosphere. The system is based on plastic void forming units originally designed for stormwater control purposes. These units are covered with a perforated foam, made from recycled foam waste, and a high strength textile. Cattle, goats, and horses have been preference tested on this surface and have been shown to prefer it to traditional straw covered flooring. Cattle spend a long time lying down on this surface and this can potentially increase milk yields. A robot is used to clean faeces off the floor continually and if it encounters an animal it will avoid it and return to that place later. Urine is filtered through the textile and is available for use as a liquid fertiliser. This paper reviews the construction of the system and report on the work done on both survival of mastitis-causing organisms in the fabric and foam layers and the drainage behaviour of liquids expressed from the foam by animal movements. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to evaluate the growth, production and quality characteristics of the hybrid sudangrass and sorghum Samurai-2 variety treated by different doses of liquid bio-slurry. This experiment was conducted using a complete randomized design with 2 factors in which the first factor was the type of plants (hybrid sudangrass and sorghum Samurai-2 variety) and the second factor included bio-slurry liquid fertilizer: P0 = no fertilizer (control), P1 = 5.750 kg bio-slurry/ha and P2 = 11.500 kg bio-slurry/ha. The data were analyzed using the variance analysis and DMRT test. There was no interaction between the types of plants and fertilization. Plant height, long of internode, number of leaves, dry matter production, crude protein content and dry matter digestibility of hybrid sudangrass (P < 0.05) were significantly higher and the NDF, ADF and ADL content were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those of the sorghum Samurai-2 variety. On the other hand, the weights of panicles and seeds of the sorghum Samurai-2 variety (P < 0.05) were higher than those of hybrid sudangrass. The fertilization with bio-slurry significantly increased (P < 0.05) the weights of panicles, seeds and crude protein content, but also significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the NDF content. It can be concluded that the hybrid sudangrass has the potential to be developed as a forage-producing crop because its production and quality are higher, while the sorghum Samurai-2 variety can be developed as a seed producer or forage. © 2018, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to clarify the effluent of wastewater from domestic wastewater and food wastewater by separating wastewater generated from food wastes or domestic animal wastes into water and sludge. Livestock wastewater treatment system and food wastewater treatment system for separating livestock wastewater and food wastewater into water and sludge were produced. The configuration of the device comprises an outer member having a cylindrical shaped and networked transfer portion, an inner member having a plurality of rotating blades arranged along a circumferential direction of the rotatable body portion rotatably disposed within the outer member. A water inlet for airtightly housing the member and the outer member and a rotating body protruding in the radial direction from the outer circumferential surface of the rotating member. Waste water is supplied between the inner member and the outer member. There is provided a sludge discharge port through which the sludge separated from the wastewater is discharged and internal rotation means for rotating the internal member with respect to the housing. We could handle more than 10 ton/h. After solid-liquid separation, the water content of solid contents was 76% for food waste and 70% for sewage sludge. After solid-liquid separation, solid component removal rate of liquid component was 40% for food wastes and 60% for sewage sludge when 0.3 mm mesh was used. The solid component removal rate of liquid component after solid-liquid separation was 32% for food wastes and 42% for sewage sludge when 0.5 mm mesh was used. The separation net size was 0.5 and 0.3 mm and clogging did not occur in this case. The solid and liquid components obtained by solid-liquid separation were not discarded but used as compost or liquid fertilizer. Also, this device can be applied to conservation of the marine environment such as disposal of garbage by dried laver. © Medwell Journals, 2018.
